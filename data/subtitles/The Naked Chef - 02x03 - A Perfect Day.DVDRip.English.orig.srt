1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,463
Naked's what I call my way of cooking.

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,571
What I cook in the restaurant
isn't what I cook at home.

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,241
Cooking's gotta be a laugh

4
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,400
it's gotta be simple, it's gotta be
tasty, it's gotta be fun.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,040
I suppose you could say it's stripping
down a recipe to its bare essentials.

6
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:20,409
No way... it's not me, it's the food.

7
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:06,730
Got a day off

8
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,367
Jools is out and about doing things

9
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,368
I've got the whole kitchen to myself.
And I'm trying to get all these things

10
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,733
that I've been meaning to do for like
the last three months

11
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,375
you know all the kitchen bits and pieces
all those kind of munchies

12
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,738
I wanna get my chillies situation back
up to where it should be

13
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,040
cos you know what I'm like about chillies?
And that's it really.

14
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,080
Sounds like a bit of a
busman's holiday to me?

15
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,549
It's not all working
just you know mucking about

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,244
I've got the boys coming round today

17
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,186
and we're going go- karting which
I'm really looking forward to

18
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,087
but apart from that
it's a pretty quiet day.

19
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,787
I'm gonna have a nice night in with
Jools tonight and keep out of trouble.

20
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,424
So - er - that's it really.

21
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,963
I'm going out to Borough market now anyway

22
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,198
I'll catch you later.

23
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm after some chillies mate - lovely.

24
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,671
I tell you what I need a load of those right

25
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,603
and I need a load of these.

26
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,637
Easy mate...
what are you doing with it all?

27
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,444
Ah - what are you gonna do with all that?

28
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,583
Got any herbs?

29
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,312
How is Mrs. Turnip?

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,584
She's alright - she's alright
she's dropped the baby to the school

31
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:37,917
How many baby turnips have you got?

32
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,527
We've got two yeah - yeah - unbelievable they are.

33
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,393
But they're growing - medium sized now.

34
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,621
When did you plant those?

35
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,061
Easy

36
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,496
Not where - I said when - er mint.

37
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,662
Going go- karting today

38
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,532
Are you?

39
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,536
- Yeah with the boys
- No

40
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,140
- Yeah
- Whereabouts you going?

41
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,900
- Up near Kings Cross
- Oh right right

44
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,646
Oh give us a tenner - good man - good man

45
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,944
Nice one mate. Look after yourself...

46
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,401
< CHILLI OIL >

47
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,912
The thing I love about chillies
is they're all different

48
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,743
they all taste different and
they all smell different

49
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,145
and they're all different shapes and sizes

50
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,343
and these are the ones kind of like

51
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,953
they're like a cross between
chilli and peppers

52
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:45,182
they're like the things they make paprika
out of by drying 'em and crumbling.

53
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,985
So what I'm gonna do

54
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,493
I'm gonna kind of preserve these
ready for a midnight munchie

55
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:54,494
so first things first - cut them
in half and we're gonna remove the seeds

56
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,535
cos all the deadly, deadly,
deadly heat is in there.

57
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,729
People always think of chillies
as something that gives heat

58
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,898
and it's not - they're actually fantastic
to eat if you give 'em half the chance.

59
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,668
So if we get rid of the seeds

60
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,904
we've got rid of half the heat already,
so that's cool.

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,411
Get 'em out - shake 'em out.

62
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:12,612
The next thing I do is wash 'em
the old fellows

63
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:17,348
because washing kind of gets rid
of quite a lot of heat as well,

64
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,183
and I know it does

65
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,655
cos when you wash it again

66
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,590
you can feel that mad kind of
it feels like the air's full of chilli.

67
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:27,261
But - er - so let's just get these
last ones done - lovely...

68
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,330
Just knock all those seeds out
and chuck 'em in there.

69
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,066
Cor you can feel it

70
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,173
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
put 'em in here

71
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,248
you can do it in a roasting tray but I've
got one of these kind of baking dishes.

72
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,715
Just plonk your chills in here and
we're gonna cook it in the oven.

73
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,952
I've got some bay leaves
and I've got some olive oil.

74
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,250
You don't want to use really,
really good olive oil

75
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,719
just enough to cover it.

76
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,686
I'm gonna bake it about 200

77
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,353
and you're going to tenderise the
chillies so it's nice and edible

78
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:01,558
but it's still gonna like maintain
that lovely kind of cup shape

79
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,224
that's what we want.

80
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,165
We don't want to cook the hell
out of it so it goes flat

81
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,397
so whack in the oven about half an hour.

82
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,874
Right these have cooled down
for about half an hour

83
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,534
but they've also been cooked
for about half and hour

84
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,942
and they're really, really soft,
and they've still got their shape

85
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,207
so they've got a nice little cup shape

86
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,614
so I can put nice little things in 'em
and just drain 'em of the oil.

87
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,119
It's not just like a chilli aggressive oil now
it's quite kind of sweet kind

88
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,225
of roasted peppery kind of oil
you know which is brill

89
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,153
So you're not going to throw that away?

90
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,921
No way - God don't do that.

91
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,631
I'm gonna put it back into this bottle

92
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:37,668
and then keep it for like pizzas and
cheese - salads - I mean fish.

93
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,326
Quite hot is it?

94
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,030
Yeah yeah course it's got a nice kick
because it's been cooked with that.

95
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,005
But look - I haven't got a funnel

96
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,909
and I've got this trick that my old
man used to do when the

97
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,613
when the old - the old lawn mower
back home used to run out of petrol

98
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:55,687
cos I always used to cut the grass for him
and I always used to run it out of petrol.

99
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,015
It used to drive him up the - up the wall.

100
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,293
Shove it down the hole - God

101
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,461
Put it in the sink.
I think it's a good idea.

102
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,360
Let's have a little pour.

103
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,298
Lovely - it's working - there we go

104
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,703
That's great you have two dishes
for the price of one?

105
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,308
Yeah but what about the funnel?

106
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,906
Lovely - so bottle - very tasty
flavoured oil.

107
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,340
So what I'm gonna do now is
stuff these chillies

108
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,351
and I'm gonna use anchovies and capers

109
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:32,389
just kind of equal amount of each.
Just gonna finely chop it.

110
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,251
I'm not gonna make it too pasty

111
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,364
looks a little bit more home made you know
Bit more love.

112
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,701
Right - that's all chopped, what do I need?

113
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,894
I need a - one of these air tight jar things

114
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,303
and you just put it into here
like that and press it in.

115
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,209
So they're kind of stuffed really?

116
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,674
They're kind of stuffed mate

117
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,205
right - then we put 'em in our little jar.

118
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,076
And we do it to all of those.

119
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,944
And they will sit very happily
in the fridge

120
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:04,819
just gagging to be used in salads,
with nice grilled, fried fish,

121
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,950
on their own as kind of not canopies
but kind of like you know things

122
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,189
to go with drinks cos like you
know cold glass of anything

123
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,230
and like the whole hot salty
thing does it for me

124
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,028
do you know when you go into
a bar and you have the olives

125
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,692
and it just gets you going
you know for dinner?

126
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:18,496
I love it

127
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,698
but to make these really, really,
really special right

128
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,003
I imagine they come out like that
and you just finely

129
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:30,047
you roughly chop some basil,
parsley, rocket, both or one of each

130
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,443
and just dress it with some balsamic
vinegar and put that on top

131
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,181
so it kind of goes like
that and that fresh

132
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,190
it's just - it's one of the most
best things I've ever eaten.

133
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,825
And you don't even have to preserve 'em
just eat 'em straight away.

134
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,329
Does Jools like chillies too?

135
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,468
I annoy my girlfriend so much
cos I'm always doing something late

136
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:54,335
whether it's the band or what ever
about one o'clock - half one,

137
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,406
I get the munchies,
so I like to go in the fridge

138
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,635
and get a bit of stale bread,
toast or whatever

139
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:03,348
get some chillies, get some gerkins
and a nice chunk of cheese

140
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,848
and my girlfriend normally wakes up

141
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,317
when she hears like the fridge
doors going late at night.

142
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,184
And she'll say what are you doing?

143
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,551
Oh God I hate you

144
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,725
and because she knows I'm gonna
come to bed stinking of gherkins

145
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,830
and blooming chillies and stuff she
thinks it's disgusting.

146
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,154
Lovely...

147
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:25,161
And then just cover it in olive oil
from my rather small canister-

148
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,737
just pour it on the sides
so it doesn't disrupt it too much.

149
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,846
So we're done - munchies
sustained for the next couple of months.

150
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,808
Jools'll be well happy when
she sees that in the fridge.

151
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:46,353
< AUBERGINE DIP >

152
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,331
Right this is another fantastic recipe

153
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,558
that like you can keep in the fridge
for a couple of days

154
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,393
little bit like

155
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,935
well I think of it a little bit like the
kind of gaucamoles and the humus

156
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,573
one of those kind of spready,
munchie type things

157
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,972
something you put in a sarnie or
on like little bits of crispy toast

158
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,842
like for munchies before drinks
or you know late night munchies or

159
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:09,980
or anything like that really.

160
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,345
Right, so I've got four
big black aubergines

161
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,918
you can use any aubergines really.

162
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:20,083
And I've roasted them at 250 degrees
for about an hour.

163
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,253
And you have this really soft,
sweet smelling kind of inside

164
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,524
and it's gone almost creamy
it's fantastic.

165
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:31,898
They call it poor man's caviar because
inside it looks a little bit like caviar

166
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,403
kind of - it looks nothing
like caviar but...

167
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,132
who invented that?

168
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:40,345
I call it Essex boy's caviar cos I think
it's a bit of a classier name you know.

169
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,414
All you have to do is like scoop
out the insides

170
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:48,186
and just get it all out and it comes
out really, really easy.

171
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,289
You could kind of put it in a Magimix
and blend it out till its smooth

172
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:55,451
but I think you lose all the character so
while we're adding the other ingredients

173
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,493
I'm gonna stir and kind of chop
with the spoon

174
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:01,657
and I'm gonna use cumin and
cumin is a fantastic spice.

175
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,597
It's a right pokey spice you know
gives you a right punch round the face.

176
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,000
And you have to go easy with it really
so I'm gonna have two pinches.

177
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:15,043
And if I need more I'll add it later but
essentially that's how much I need.

178
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,411
So once you've got it to a nice powder

179
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:22,951
yeah - I'm gonna get some garlic in there,
some nice little background flavour.

180
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:32,124
I only need like a normal size clove
I just peel it and pound that up as well.

181
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,528
Once you've got that into a nice paste,

182
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:41,365
get it in here, scoop it out
and stir that in.

183
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:48,036
If you put that in while it's warm it'll
kind of get the flavour really happening.

184
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:53,014
Now the next thing to do is we want to
tweak the flavour with olive oil

185
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:57,213
peppery olive oil, - salt and pepper and
then it'll start beginning to taste nice.

186
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,218
Let's have my olive oil

187
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,383
I'm gonna put about sort of five tablespoons of ol

188
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,159
Are you looking forward to going go-karting?

189
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,957
Yeah too right mate - I can't wait.

190
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,156
I've never been before

191
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,962
but like I've always fancied myself as
a bit of a tiger on the race tracks.

192
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:17,569
And I suppose that comes from an up
bringing of having a mother drives like Nigel

193
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,803
Nigel Mansell.
You know when you're at school

194
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,209
and you've got groups of friends
that are into different things

195
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,146
girls, trainers, sports and then
the ones that are into cars.

196
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,115
Well they always used to kind
of like gather round

197
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,653
and get out the bus queue to
watch my old dear come in

198
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,882
she'd got wooom...
and then I used to get in and wooo

199
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,460
and they used to go oh yeah man
she did a wheel spin in second.

200
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,493
And that was my mum all over

201
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:43,659
and then just to like to top it all off my
old man is completely different

202
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,203
he does an average of about 25 miles
an hour in 5th gear

203
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,673
and he just sits there kind of...
like the whole world going by him

204
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,004
not really concentrating.

205
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:58,207
He used to blooming get me to school late
and then when I went from school

206
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,579
I'd miss Neighbours cos it would take
about an hour and a half to get home.

207
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,277
So embarrassing.

208
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,720
Yeah that tastes good
that tastes seasoned now right

209
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,918
and it even tastes nice,
but what I wanna do now

210
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:13,054
is balance that oily thing with
lemon and a nice bit of coriander.

211
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,796
You want that kind of acidic thing
that's the really important thing

212
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,597
you've got - you've got that kind
of oily, creamy aubergine,

213
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,365
you've got the cumin there so there's
kind of like spice there,

214
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:25,033
but it's the lemon juice that's gonna
really turn it around like a million times.

215
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,146
So - you wanna about one and
a half lemons in there.

216
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,915
But add one lemon and then taste it
stir it in and taste it.

217
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,790
That's really good actually
I'm just gonna add one lemon

218
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,249
and also it's still warm so when
it gets cold it's gonna be beautiful.

219
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,193
So I've got a nice bunch of coriander
that I've just washed and shaken off.

220
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,867
I'm just gonna use about half of that
just kind of finely chop it

221
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,004
because those stalks are really,
really sweet and quite crunchy

222
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,140
and when you get onto leaves just
kind of slightly more roughly chop 'em.

223
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,766
When this is finished it tastes
so good that I've even had it

224
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,311
with like some really nice - on a plate

225
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,644
a big dollop like you'd have like mash
potatoes with like lamb chops or something

226
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:09,652
I'd have a big dollop with some like
mustardy leaves like rocket or watercress

227
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,620
or something and some seared scallops
or even like things

228
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,819
like white fish are brilliant or shell fish
absolutely superb.

229
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:20,830
Or lamb - even better with lamb
roasted lamb - sliced up and that ...

230
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,605
Rock on - that's really nice.
So do you wanna try some?

231
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,933
I'd love to

232
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,367
Just put a rack on

233
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:34,436
I'm gonna do a kind of melba toast thing.
And these sort of things like are fantastic.

234
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:35,512
I remember when I went to college

235
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,310
and there was all like these kind of
canopies and stuff going on

236
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:43,080
canopies this, canopies that - aspic jelly
and little students breathing over things

237
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:47,625
putting things in shapes and like flavour
to sort of work effort and taste wise

238
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,285
it's all in my eyes completely wrong.

239
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,657
So you're not a vol-au-vent man then?

240
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,856
I'm not a vol-au-vent man
it's too much time you know

241
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,593
think about how long that took me
and this is fantastic.

242
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,363
And then imagine having a glass
of champagne or beer in your hand

243
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:03,168
just imagine.
And tuck in -so what do you think?

244
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:05,708
Delicious

245
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,345
Nice isn't it?

246
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,591
Lovely

247
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,558
< CARSPACIO OF BEEF >

248
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,263
I've invited everyone back
for a bit of tucker

249
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:45,234
so on the way back I picked up
this quite large filet of beef

250
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,872
and I'm gonna make something
really, really quick

251
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,374
really, really colourful and fantastic and
tasty, real fiesty little thing, so ideal.

252
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:56,777
So what I'm gonna do - put a pan on
basically what I'm doing is a carpachio

253
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,882
a carpachio of beef yeah
which classically is always raw

254
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:05,114
but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna sear it
it's still gonna be like rare,

255
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,920
roary rarey yeah but I'm gonna have
a nice little seared rim yeah

256
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:12,496
and I'm gonna encrust it with like
seasoning and spices and stuff like that.

257
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,259
Right - so I've got coriander seed that's the litt

258
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,192
you want a good handful cos coriander
seeds are quite mellow

259
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,831
now in comparison to like coriander the
leaf which is quite fragrant and fresh.

260
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,436
You just bash 'em and all
this smell comes out

261
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,979
that's what I love about the old pestle
and mortar - it's fantastic

262
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,549
push the beef to one side and I'm gonna
use this chopping board

263
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:38,315
and I'm just gonna season it quite
generously with pepper and then salt

264
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,058
I thought you were having a quiet
night in with Jools tonight?

265
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,388
Don't say that cos you'll make me feel
guilty- I opened my mouth didn't I?

266
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,499
I got a bit too excited and I said oh
yeah come back to my house.

267
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,102
So she doesn't know yet,
but she should be cool about it.

268
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:56,739
Right- salt, pepper, coriander seeds and
then just roll the beef over it like that

269
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:01,937
and it will just stick to it and encrust
it. Just gonna put a touch of oil

270
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,150
just - I'm gonna use the chilli oil as
well - I told you it would come in handy.

271
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:11,052
So just put that over the beef,
and then basically kind of pat it in

272
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:15,421
and just so it's got a little layer
of kind of oil and then

273
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,456
you know it's not gonna stick
or anything like that.

274
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,327
So we want it to toast now and almost
like get all those spices and stuff going.

275
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,168
I'll turn it about every minute, minute
and a half so what I'm gonna do now

276
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:28,171
basically is get some nice sort of things
to sprinkle on the top.

277
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:33,005
I'm gonna take this kind of like in a
Thai direction which is slightly unusual

278
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,741
but really, really tasty, and I've got
coriander and I've got ginger.

279
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:42,047
First of all get your old coriander
and just roll it up like it was a cigar

280
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,054
or something like that - slice it thinly.

281
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:53,157
Push that up there - that's the old
coriander - so - let's have a little look.

282
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,568
Yeah like that - fantastic.
I'm well chuffed with that.

283
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:04,107
Right then the ginger -just chop it
up finely into little flecks.

284
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:10,675
Lovely - put that in there.
Right this looks pretty damned good.

285
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,516
Lovely - right so what we're gonna
do is just turn the gas off

286
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,713
push it to one side - let it kind of relax
for about sort of 5/10 minutes.

287
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:19,448
Why do you do that?

288
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,185
Well the thing is like
imagine if like you're really warm

289
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,522
and I chucked you in a cold
swimming pool yeah

290
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,928
you're gonna go oh like that and the other
way round it's kind of the same for meat

291
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,159
if you've got cold meat and
it goes in a hot pan like

292
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:34,331
goes like that and it's really,
really tight and contracting

293
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,341
and all the juice cooks into the middle
and then when you let it relax it goes

294
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,207
oh... kind of Hamlet moment you know.
Take it easy

295
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,008
and then all the juice goes back to
where it should be and then you slice it

296
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,515
it's tender, it tastes nice,
it falls apart in your mouth.

297
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,143
Otherwise it's tough as old boots.
So what I need now is I need some

298
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:54,122
chillies, and radish
look at these lovely radishes.

299
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,261
The leaves are like
if you just taste one

300
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,988
so tasty and like what's the point
of throwing it away

301
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,690
we'll have that on the bottom of the
plate and it'll look really, really nice.

302
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:07,769
And then I'm gonna slice 'em and
then I've got the old chillies

303
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,067
right so what I'm gonna do is
take the old tops off

304
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:15,142
lose the seeds and try and slice 'em
at an angle as finely as possible.

305
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,012
Right - we're sorted.
I need a big, big plate.

306
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:27,054
Get the old meat - and you can slice it up
so I mean it's that easy

307
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,716
you know and it takes no time at all.

308
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,295
So just slice it as thinly as you possibly can

309
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,294
How many will that feed then do you think?

310
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:37,061
And then we cut it like this and
we're gonna kind of flavour it like this

311
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,863
you'd serve like
8/10 people out of it

312
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,973
so you're actually stretching quite
an expensive bit of meat a long way.

313
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:47,875
And if I'm really lucky - I might even get
left overs so I can have my sarnie tomorrow.

314
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,447
Right - here we go.
This is how simple it is

315
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,813
lovely kind of leaves of the radish
which are nice and mustardy yeah

316
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,920
just sprinkle about the place yeah

317
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:00,115
and then you wanna kind of really
casually kind of drape this meat,

318
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,090
and the whole idea is that we wanna
make one layer so we can put all these

319
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,163
lovely flavours on and they can
all get exposed to it you know?

320
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:09,096
What I wanna do now is just like you know

321
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,728
we wanna get the ginger and
from a height just like scatter

322
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,333
you don't wanna get too low
and put it all on one bit

323
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,773
you know and then like coriander

324
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,805
And then let's have a bit of radish.

325
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,777
Fantastic.

326
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:31,383
And then let's have the
chilli - again - lovely.

327
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,822
So that is absolutely pucker right.
And it's lively and it looks cool,

328
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:39,123
but to get it all happening get
some sesame seed oil right

329
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,564
which is pretty potent stuff really
and just kind of really lightly dribble

330
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,569
and just work into the middle
in like a little circle.

331
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,406
Soy sauce you can be really generous

332
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,874
you just make sure that every bit of
meat has got soy sauce over

333
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,707
and then you've got the lines yeah
squeeze it...

334
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:02,344
yeah - there we go mate.
Happy days - we're all done.

335
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,047
< NOODLE SALAD >

336
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:11,922
The thing I really love about these salads
is that like you can pick up something

337
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:16,591
like you know a mushroom and
if you slice it like nice and thinly

338
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,761
lengthwise all of a sudden it looks
almost oriental you know.

339
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:23,033
But I've got some rocket,
bean sprouts, red and green peppers.

340
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,609
Got my spring onions.
You know you can four things

341
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,040
or you can have ten things,

342
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:31,309
but the main thing is that
it's all crunchy and looks nice.

343
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,376
So let's just plonk this in here.

344
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:38,247
Lovely baby spinach - right
plonk that in there.

345
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:42,121
Let's check out our - the old noods...

346
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,230
...all sticking

347
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,955
They don't take very long to cook those do they?

348
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,565
No - couple of minutes.

349
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:52,661
What else have we got?

350
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:57,031
Yeah nice
I've got some coriander and some mint.

351
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,406
I think it's amazing that you can just
invite a lot of people

352
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,376
round for supper at the drop of a hat

353
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,411
Food doesn't always have to be
lots of work or a palaver

354
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,915
or be all official about it you know

355
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:10,021
it's just about getting your mates round
and getting the old boys fed really.

356
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,622
Soon as the boys and girls get here today

357
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,451
I'm gonna give 'em some of
my Essex boy caviar

358
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,356
bit of toast and I'll get the old
stuffed chillies out as well

359
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,964
and finish that off with the rocket and
balsamic vinegar and they will love it.

360
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,799
Right this my perfect day mate and
it's certainly turning out to be anyway.

361
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,501
Nothing like having all your mates
round for a bit of tucker.

362
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:32,468
Obviously you don't wanna put warm
noodles into the lovely cold crispy,

363
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:37,639
crunchy baked veggies, so we'll get 'em
nice and cold. Let that drain.

364
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,617
I've got these cashews that I've just
put in the oven for 5 minutes,

365
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,648
just to get nice and golden
and they're fantastic

366
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,516
when you - when you
come across one of those

367
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,920
it'll be nice little surprise
cos it'll taste lovely.

368
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,582
Now I'm gonna make
a dressing yeah

369
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,558
and of late I've just started
doing it in a jam jar

370
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,196
because whatever you don't use
put it in the fridge

371
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,628
and use it for the next couple of
days you know so it's good.

372
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,360
Just gonna chop up the chilli
I'm not gonna take the seed out this time

373
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:01,028
I'm just gonna chop them nice and thinly.
So we just put that in the old jam jar.

374
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,208
Garlic - only a little bit of garlic

375
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:08,870
it's just for a little bit of background
flavour -just kind of finely slice that

376
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:12,279
and then I've gotta about a thumb
sized piece of ginger

377
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:16,888
and I'm just gonna run through that and
finely chop it so it's nice and dinky.

378
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:22,627
Get your limes - and squeeze 'em in to

379
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,388
brilliant right

380
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,862
so we have four limes in there.

381
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,967
We now need to get soy sauce
in there yeah?

382
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,164
Couple of tablespoons just to give
it that lovely taste

383
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:37,270
and you want about a tablespoon of
sesame seed oil cos it's quite strong

384
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:38,774
you don't wanna overdo it.

385
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:43,005
And then about you know 2/3 times
as much oil as there is lime juice

386
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:49,385
so about that much. Put the lid on
give it a good old... go on my son

387
00:24:54,226 --> 00:25:03,533
Yeah - so get the old noodles in there
have all the bits coming out and stuff

388
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:08,096
I won't use it all cos save this
for tomorrow.

389
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,632
We just dress it.

390
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,781
Get stuck in there - brilliant colours.

391
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:22,480
Just tastes brill and it smells
amazing actually.

392
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:26,246
Beautiful - I am so chuffed about this
it's gonna look brilliant. So that's done

393
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:32,119
Let me show you what I normally have
if desert's required - secret weapon

394
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:37,835
if in doubt get the old Maltesers out
mate - pop the bags right

395
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,496
and then you put a cloth over it
and you bash the hell out of it.

396
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:48,846
And I'm gonna give them this

397
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:53,313
cos it's so tasty crumbled or
sprinkled over vanilla ice cream.

398
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,214
There you go - we're all really raring to go.

399
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,684
Oh God - Jools is back - get it cleaned up.

400
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,159
Yeah...
