1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,326
Naked's what I call my way of cooking

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,596
what I cook in the restaurant
isn't what I cook at home.

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,139
Cooking's gotta be a laugh.

4
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:11,471
It's gotta be simple.
It's gotta be tasty. It's gotta be fun.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,077
I suppose you could say it's striping down
the recipe to its bare essentials.

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,110
No way it's me - it's the food.

7
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,463
My mate Tim's coming over from Germany

8
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,302
we worked in an Italian
restaurant together

9
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,103
and I'm just checking his flights

10
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,247
he's coming from Hamburg and he's
going to London Stanstead airport

11
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:49,608
and it's all on time.

12
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:52,342
Have you got anything special planned
for Tim's visit?

13
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:54,918
Not really - he kind of shook ma
little bit because I just

14
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,488
well you know typical me...
oh yeah we'll do this

15
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,285
and I said oh we should get a reunion
sorted and then he like

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,927
e-mailed me back about 4 days ago

17
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,790
and said I'm coming
I've booked the flight

18
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,955
so it was like oh oh
gotta get a party together quick.

19
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,363
So I'm basically just get all
of the people from work,

20
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:11,662
that we used to work with.
Do an Italian meal.

21
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,669
So I've gotta do a fair bit of shopping

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,671
not much it's pretty simple cooking actually.

23
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,140
And then I've gotta go and pick him up a bit later

24
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,869
I'm gonna do him a big sign
don't know what I'm gonna write on it yet

25
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,709
but I've always wanted a welcome
like that at the old airport.

26
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,009
And I've never had one.

27
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,718
Ah bonjourno... (speaks Italian)

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,054
Belissimo...

29
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:13,761
Can I have 10 slices of your best
pachuta my friend? Graci

30
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,401
You taste it?

31
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,598
Yeah lovely... graci

32
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,104
fantastic

33
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,443
Belissimo - can I have the mozzarella...

34
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,560
Graci that's beautiful...

35
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:05,842
< MOzzARELLA, PEACH
AND PARMA HAM SALAD >

36
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,514
Right my darling
I'm gonna make a fantastic salad

37
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,316
it's all around like mixed leaves

38
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:16,622
you can have what you like to be honest
but - er - let me get a plate or two.

39
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,625
Big plates - honestly
they'll do you a favour

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,792
buy a couple of plates and it makes
life so much easier

41
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,530
chuck it in the middle of the table
none of this plated up business.

44
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,034
which you can get in the supermarket

45
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,374
which it's just peppery and a little
bit more interesting really.

46
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,348
All you have to do is like scatter
the old salad all round the plate

47
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,647
really really casually
sort of one layer really

48
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,756
Do you always use a salad spinner?

49
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,416
Actually I used to slag 'em off like
you wouldn't believe.

50
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:48,958
I tell you what I've found lately instead

51
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:53,224
I mean it's dead - it's dead tempting to
buy those bags of salad isn't it?

52
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,491
I mean I've done it

53
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,635
you open them and they just go
horrible really quick

54
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,794
and sometimes they're bruised
or haven't been spun properly

55
00:03:58,971 --> 00:03:59,960
and a bit too wet

56
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,664
so I just - and it's much cheaper
to go and buy your own ones

57
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,400
but you know it doesn't
take any more time.

58
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,841
Give them a little wash
spin 'em in the old salad spinner

59
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,846
and then if you put 'em in the
fridge with the old lid on

60
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,779
I think maybe because it's
protected by that

61
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,384
the fridge doesn't sort of ruin it

62
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,714
and make it sort of wilt quick
so you know it's dead good.

63
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:22,316
And then let's - I've got these fantastic
pucker peaches, pucker peaches mate.

64
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:26,795
Fruit in salads - very, very under rated
not done that much really.

65
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,094
You could peel the skins but I actually
like the skin personally but

66
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,964
just give 'em a wash.

67
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:37,701
So all I do is you just cut it like an
avocado in the middle - right - twist it

68
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,310
that comes out and if don't come out

69
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,106
it ain't ripe so you shouldn't be
using it in the first place.

70
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,150
Try that my old darling.
Have a nosh on that. Mmm- lovely.

71
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,949
And then you just rip it like that and
a ripped peach looks so much better

72
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,752
than a cut one. Because it just doesn't
look commercial and horrible

73
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,827
so I just do that to all of them.
Peaches are there.

74
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:02,400
I've got some - got some nice Mozzarella
yeah and er - got this from the deli

75
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,036
and it's Buffalo Mozzarella
sounds bit weird

76
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,605
but Buffalo Mozzarella is much
nicer in salads

77
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:11,265
it's really soft and milky as
opposed to the sort of

78
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,571
the cheaper stuff which
is better for pizzas.

79
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,371
So give it a try - you can get it
in the supermarket actually

80
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:22,419
so just open the bag up and again just rip
it into nice little mouth sized pieces

81
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,556
and just kind of put it
around the plate in

82
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,521
and around the peaches and
the leaves and stuff.

83
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:28,125
Is it called Buffalo because
it's so big?

84
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,023
No - it's Buffalo because
it's Buffalo milk.

85
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,828
But they're also very big so yeah.

86
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,936
But er - you're so sweet darling.
There you go.

87
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,470
And I think that looks amazing already,
so what have I forgotten

88
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:48,046
oh yeah - Parma ham - get this in the
supermarket get 'em to slice it for you.

89
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:51,547
Ask them if you can taste it first the
Parma ham right and if you just notice

90
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:54,185
if it's too thick, sometimes they do it
too thick and it drives me up the wall.

91
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,845
It's like eating a bit of old shoe...
so say can I have it a bit thinner please?

92
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,254
Just get a nice strip like that
and just tear it up

93
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:04,089
and just kind of almost sort of
drape it in and around the cheese

94
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,595
and the peaches and the leaves.

95
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:09,232
I can't really stress how fantastic
this salad is

96
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,768
because if you imagine like
the peppery leaves

97
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,873
like a bit of oil and lemon over it
fantastic yeah

98
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,975
salty like Parma ham right

99
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,277
and the milky Mozzarella and the juicy,
juicy peach.

100
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,708
Fantastic

101
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,940
Just a little bit of salad over the top
just a little

102
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,152
and got some lovely mint here

103
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,552
just kind of pick it - rip it -just a
little bit on the top's quite fresh

104
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,989
and I think brings the flavour of the
peaches out quite nice

105
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,028
and once we get a nice bit of oil and
lemon juice on there be lovely.

106
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,188
But I won't do that now because
I'll have to do it later

107
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,698
otherwise it'll kill all the salad leaves.

108
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,560
So you can sort of do it
this far in advance?

109
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,138
I can do - well - I should do it there and
then but I can do it this far in advance

110
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,501
and get away with it

111
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,643
so all I have to do now is take it
out the fridge a little bit

112
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,473
before I need it so it just gets
to room temperature'ish

113
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,308
squeeze a couple of lemons,
double the amount of olive oil

114
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:01,044
bit of salt and pepper - all over it.
Beautiful mate.

115
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,187
And a bit of bread with it or something?

116
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,686
Yeah

117
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:10,461
< TWO NUT CHOCOLATE
TORTE CHEESECAKE >

118
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,922
Two nuts chocolate torte cheesecake mould

119
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,533
but you can pretty much use
anything you like really.

120
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,362
I just find it easy cos
you can click it out.

121
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,561
Butter - 250 grams of butter.

122
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:24,574
What do I need? Oh - grease proof paper
- right -just rip off a bit

123
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,369
little square that you know
is gonna cover it yeah?

124
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:30,242
And what I do - bit like making
a paper airplane

125
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,316
actually it's nothing like making
a paper airplane

126
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:37,081
you fold the paper in the middle
and then you turn it around

127
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,689
fold it into the middle.

128
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:43,192
Then you basically you just keep
folding into the middle - like that

129
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:47,731
I do one more - so you guess
or much that is into the middle

130
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,133
put your finger where it is
and just rip it up.

131
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,742
Ohh - lovely! - So that's gonna
line the bottom yeah.

132
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,336
We just need to get a bit of butter on it
and that'll stop anything from sticking.

133
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:05,348
So just very thinly line the bottom
and the sides

134
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,782
and just put a bit of butter on this.

135
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,888
Yeah - lovely - and then stick that
on the bottom - nice and snug.

136
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:16,422
Right - so there's nothing gonna stick.
Right - forget that now.

137
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:21,555
So - I need 300 grams of nuts
it's called 2 nuts Taut

138
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,497
because it's got two nuts
in it basically

139
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,230
we've got walnuts and almonds
and I need 150 grams of each yeah

140
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,806
which is pretty simple to remember.

141
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,475
And these are 100 gram packets so
there's 100 grams of almonds

142
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:37,843
there's 100 grams of almonds

143
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,951
and I'm not gonna get the scales
out or nothing like that.

144
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:44,112
Just pour out the nuts and divide
it into two - same with walnuts

145
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,986
I think where at all possible not
use the scales okay.

146
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,525
So just divide the old nuts into half again.

147
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:58,029
What I'm gonna do - got the old Magimix
chuck the nuts in there - okay.

148
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:02,305
And we're gonna whizz it up until it's
a powder - 30 seconds, 40 seconds.

149
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:09,913
Lovely - so look what we got yeah
it's fantastic

150
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,549
that's what it should be
it's like powder.

151
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:16,154
Right chocolate - it is a chocolate Taut
we need 300 grams of chocolate.

152
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,721
One we're gonna put here - two

153
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,127
I'm gonna crumble up 200 grams of this

154
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:27,595
and chuck it in with the nuts and er
we're gonna whizz that up as well.

155
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:34,337
Makes a bit of a noise but you just wanna
break it up into pieces. - Alright?

156
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,205
Better than watching telly.

157
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:43,838
Anyway we'll lose this into a bowl
now we're gonna put the butter in here

158
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,685
just plonk the whole lot in there
rip it into two or three.

159
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:52,722
We need 100 grams of sugar
lovely. And pour that in.

160
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,122
And that's just for a little
bit of extra sweetness.

161
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:01,791
And we wanna whizz this up for about
whip - I wanna whiz

162
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:04,993
whizz this up - so it gets nice
and shiny and creamy.

163
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:10,771
So I need 6 eggs yeah - cor
organic of course.

164
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,705
I'm gonna crack my eggs in
here very carefully.

165
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:21,419
And then what I do - I pinch the
yolk and plop 'em in one by one

166
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,452
and that's gonna really enrich and that.

167
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:26,056
And make it nice and silky and beautiful.

168
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,123
Lovely - all you have to do now
is get it all together

169
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,155
so just mix these up until
it's nicely mixed.

170
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,137
Right - now the best bit
egg whites.

171
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,537
Flavour -lift - we have to
get 'em together,

172
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,507
but I wanna get these really stiff
so at the last minute

173
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,671
add a good pinch of salt and that
kind of helps it to be stiff

174
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,178
and whip it up my old darling.

175
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,154
I've got a bit of a mad day because
I've got - got to go and pick ...

176
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,620
has given me some mushrooms for
the main course and

177
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,585
and now I've gotta go and pick up
Tim from the airport

178
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
so I can't be late otherwise
the poor old boy

179
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,321
he thinks he's going into London
cos it's Stanstead airport

180
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,329
but it's not as central

181
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,561
it's out in the wilderness where I come
from so he'll be getting... London

182
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,538
Jamie where are you?

183
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,482
Done. Right so - er
add a little bit first

184
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,108
fold it in just to loosen it.

185
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,081
Now as it's air that we've
got in the egg whites

186
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,555
what we need to do is get it in
there into the mix

187
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,388
without sort of knocking all the air out
of it - otherwise it won't rise.

188
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,826
So what we do is we call it like
a folding action

189
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:43,128
do sort of movements like that that kind
of fold in from the outside to the middle

190
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,736
and maybe change and go from
the middle to the outside.

191
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,065
It's good for a couple of days

192
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,173
I mean when it's got a bit
stale just crumble it up

193
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:53,471
and add some ice cream over it.
Mmm- baby - so here we go.

194
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,812
Shake it so it's flat.
And you can cook it straight away

195
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,385
but the reason I held this other
100 grams of chocolate back

196
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,350
if you get the chocolate and
just push it in with your finger

197
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,584
and just sort of put it here

198
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,921
there and everywhere.

199
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,029
Cos when they cook - when you cut into it

200
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:13,664
you have that lovely like sea of chocolate

201
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:16,357
that lovely taut and then there's just
a little bit with like running chocolate

202
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,628
that comes out - it's fantastic
and I love that.

203
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:22,137
Beautiful - in the oven
about 190 for about an hour

204
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,869
just test it with a little knife
if it comes out clean - we're off mate.

205
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,342
Cool. Let's go

206
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,112
How are you?

207
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,872
I'm alright mate
How are you?

208
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:03,514
Alright

209
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:04,376
Have you got those mushrooms?

210
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,482
Yes I've got them
Good man

211
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,347
I spent all day yesterday to
collect those mushrooms

212
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,717
And they're beautifully honestly
they're nice...

213
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,857
Show me show me show me...

214
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,493
Okay hold on a minute... I'm too old.

215
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:22,123
You're not too old mate. - Look at those
yeah... fantastic...

216
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:24,565
oh thanks mate - that's brilliant.

217
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:28,229
Listen... cos I'm going on
the train to pick up Tim

218
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,897
I've bought my own box cos
it fits in my bag

219
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,669
can you just put
I only need half of that lot...

220
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,641
...this is too small...

221
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,746
No no - it's only for 7 people
just half of those...

222
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:38,212
Half of these
...I collected these mushroom

223
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,218
you just wanna bloody half of these
mushroom... hold on a minute...

224
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,357
Hello Jamie Baby... hi how are you?

225
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,898
How are you?

226
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:56,830
Great not bad at all.

227
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,764
Right you ready for tonight?

228
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:01,394
Yeah that's great - so what's on the menu?

229
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,837
Secret mate - I'm not telling
I'm not telling you anything...

230
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,173
Cheers...

231
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,013
So I'll see you a bit later...

232
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,317
I'm all day in side

233
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,626
See you Tonight

234
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:25,729
See you later

235
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:29,933
Bye

236
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,433
Bye

237
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,982
< SEA BREAM WITH
MASHROOMS & POTATOES >

238
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,083
So are you happy to see Tim?

239
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,917
Yeah it's fantastic seeing the old boy

240
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,926
still on good form - he's just having a little sho

241
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,031
Getting cleaned up cos I said he's
I said he smelt.

242
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,135
So what we got is thinly sliced potatoes
in the tray - the oven's on full whack.

243
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:42,797
A really nice seasoning
potatoes and salt and pepper

244
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,069
you can't really go wrong
roasted, fried, whatever.

245
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:50,478
Add a little bit of olive oil.
Just enough olive oil to coat them really.

246
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,514
And just sort of with your hands

247
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:55,881
just - you wanna make sure every bit
every slice gets a bit.

248
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,382
Just lay 'em out nice and flat
so it's like one layer

249
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,422
whack 'em in the oven
for about 15 minutes.

250
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,889
Give 'em a nice good roasting yeah.

251
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,589
So while that's cooking got some nice
mushrooms from Ginaro - right.

252
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,891
And I'm a very big mushroom fan.

253
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,733
I've got Chantarelle here
got Girolle here - the classic...

254
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:18,900
old oysters - trumpette d'amour
and pierre de mouton.

255
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:23,446
Right - they're not cheap.
But I think wild mushrooms have character.

256
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,311
They have a certain flavour, certain
texture - they cook in a certain way.

257
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,784
It's turned something very - quite normal
into something that looks exciting

258
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:30,819
and that's what it's all about.

259
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,457
If you haven't got much money get
don't use button mushrooms

260
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,587
forget them forever - get your Chitakes
or your field or Portobello mushrooms

261
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,197
slice 'em up - cook 'em well with
a little bit of this

262
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,833
and maybe a little bit of dried mushroom
porchini - morrell

263
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,559
they're quite expensive but
you need the smallest amount

264
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:47,136
and it will liven 'em up and
make 'em taste fantastic.

265
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,869
Most supermarkets stock little
punnet of like...

266
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,839
Do you wash them?

267
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:58,676
No - well Girano very kind of him
has clean them up for me

268
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,445
but with wild mushrooms if you wash them
they'll soak up all the water

269
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,747
and they'll cook and taste of nothing
you're diluting the flavour.

270
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,015
What you do is you brush them with a brush

271
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,854
and you get like maybe trim them up with
a knife and I'm gonna fry these off

272
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:14,431
so first of all - I'm gonna just chop
up a little bit of garlic

273
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,326
just about two cloves really
just for flavour.

274
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:27,544
Olive oil right - hot pan - and I'm just
gonna put the mushrooms in.

275
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:34,881
And then the garlic - when the mushrooms
cook the water will cook out of the yeah?

276
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,987
And normally that's when people think
oh they're cooked.

277
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:40,056
What I will say is let the water come out
carry on cooking it

278
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,194
cook the water away and then there's
so much flavour in that water anyway

279
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,024
cos it's from inside the mushroom
let it cook back into it again

280
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,325
and then you get that nice
fried thing happening.

281
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:51,200
The other trick is

282
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:55,403
get a good bit of salt and pepper in it
now cos like mushrooms are like

283
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,643
they're like sponges really and when
they cook... sucking it all in

284
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:01,278
and if it's just a little bit
of oil and garlic

285
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,970
well then yeah you know it's not
the end of the world,

286
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,911
but if you've got salt and pepper
then it's like yeah

287
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:09,986
it's tasting good you know. So - next
bit is the old fish and herbs so...

288
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:15,523
I would like to serve this with Sea
Bass but it's not always available

289
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,391
and it's quite expensive,
so I've got Sea Bream

290
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,291
and I think they call it Royal Bream
cos they've got a little crest on its head

291
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,061
which is supposed to be a crown.

292
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,471
So what I'm gonna do is I haven't
got a plastic board so

293
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,204
so I'm just gonna put a bit of cling
film on the board

294
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,005
cos I don't like fish
fish on wooden boards.

295
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:35,972
Why's that?

296
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,048
Well just you know you get
fish juice on the old board

297
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:40,844
and then you go and make a cheese sarnie
the next day and it tastes of fish.

298
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:47,219
Not very nice. So anyway.
Put your old fish on here -these herbs

299
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,818
I've got some flat leaf parsley
and I've got some purple basil

300
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,625
but you can use any fragrant delicate herb
I would

301
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,759
I wouldn't use tarragon but you know
things like green basil, dill, fennel tops

302
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,399
so right. With the fillet - lovely fillets

303
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:06,135
I pinch it at the breast - breast
it's not a chicken!

304
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,576
Right pinch it at the fillet yeah
so it kind of puckers it up yeah?

305
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:14,481
And then you just at an angle slice
like that -just a little bit

306
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,622
with all of them. You can do one,
two, three, four slashes

307
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,748
we'll just go listen can you hear
starting to fry.

308
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,031
So it's starting to you know it's gone
shiny now and the moisture's gone

309
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,963
and they look fantastic
I'm turning it off.

310
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,933
And what I'm gonna do now is just er

311
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:38,134
with my hand just kind of
open up that slash yeah

312
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,505
little touch of salt to get
it in the cracks.

313
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,171
Pinch some herbs and just sort
of push 'em in there to the gap

314
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,045
just you know gives it the flavour
a little tickle.

315
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,553
Just finish these old fish.

316
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,655
Right - so the fish looks pucker.

317
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,959
Potatoes - yeah - yeah - they're soft
well they're cooked,

318
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,597
they're soft and they're slightly
golden which is just what I want

319
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,666
just gonna let 'em cool down a little bit
cos if we start wanting to move 'em

320
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,665
about they'll just break
because they're hot.

321
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,669
Nice knob of butter into the old mushrooms
at this point when the heat's off

322
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,208
and that'll melt and we'll squeeze in some
lemon - probably only need one.

323
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:18,376
Yeah lovely! - Nice chunk of parsley
right - potatoes

324
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,580
get like a palette knife or one of these
and just sort of - where's my old cloth?

325
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:26,153
Here

326
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:28,849
Right - basically just scrap
up the potatoes

327
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,159
very carefully because you don't
want to break 'em

328
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:33,729
so they'll be a little bit stuck
but they'll be nice and golden.

329
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:39,894
Whether you do this for two people or ten
just simple - simple, simple simple.

330
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,269
Put all these lovely mushrooms and all
the juice - don't leave anything

331
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,967
all the herbs - get it onto the old potatoes

332
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,711
you can mix it up anyway you like really

333
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:52,407
make sure that mushroom juice and butter
and flavour goes on to the potatoes.

334
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:58,616
And just shake it - so it's flat right
and it just looks so damned good now.

335
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,781
The fish is going on top yeah
skin side up.

336
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:05,191
Right - and it's going in the top of the
oven so the fish skin will become crispy

337
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:07,388
but because this is already cooked
at the bottom right

338
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,501
you're gonna heat and cook it a touch more
won't get that much heat.

339
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,832
But it will steam and all those lovely
mushroom flavours will cook into the

340
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:17,702
into the fish and then in return the
fish is gonna sort of like

341
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,004
all the juices will cook out the fish
and go into the potatoes. Lovely.

342
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,138
So now we just drizzle it with a bit of
olive oil - make it go crispy.

343
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,686
In the oven for about five, six minutes.

344
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,983
< SALSA VERDE >

345
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,751
I'm gonna make a sauce to go with the fish

346
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:40,558
It's called Salsa Verdi and it's an
Italian word for - green sauce

347
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:45,328
which doesn't sound quite as impressive
does it - so we use the Italian.

348
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,836
But basically... sounds like Tim's
got the old basket ball...

349
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,945
and we need to finely chop it.

350
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,942
Oh Timmy come and give us a hand Tiger!

351
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,309
Coming

352
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,854
Alright handsome - eh
looking very swish mate.

353
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,927
Mmm- you smell good too...

354
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,097
So what you like me to do then?

355
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:19,431
I've got some herbs in the old
in the old frigo

356
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,897
you can have the big board because
you're a tiger.

357
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:25,471
I'll get you a big chopper
there you go mate - big enough?

358
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,043
Thank you - that will do

359
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,009
So what sort of herbs have you got there?

360
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:29,481
Tim chops up herbs?

361
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,245
Basically we've got parsley,
mint and basil

362
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,045
and classically it should just be
parsley but I like the basil and mint

363
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,188
cos it lightens it up a bit and
it's going with fish so

364
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,882
kind of makes sense to me.
I finely chop my garlic

365
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:50,097
I need some gherkins - gherkins, mustard,
capers and anchovies - there you go.

366
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,301
So we use about 7 anchovy fillets

367
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:54,665
Very strong flavours?

368
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,567
Yeah

369
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,338
Smells nice -just chop 'em up.

370
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,004
It's a bit of chopping

371
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,909
I mean to be honest you can do
this in the Magimix

372
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,880
it's just that I think that when you
do it by hand it looks a bit more rustic...

373
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:10,781
I have a connection with Germany before
before I met Tim

374
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,857
was my first girlfriend
her name was Helgar Buge right?

375
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,956
She was German and I was about 12 and she
was about that much taller than me.

376
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,396
And I went out with her for 2 weeks
snogged her mate

377
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,899
...China in your arms,
giving it some of that...

378
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,506
smooching, dancing, and I really like her
and then she chucked me.

379
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:34,168
She chucked me and I cried and - but then
when I went to youth club the next week

380
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:37,747
everyone was laughing at me cos she told
'em that I kissed like a cartwheel...

381
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,884
but it wasn't me - it was her fault anyway
cos she was so tall

382
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,548
I was like... like a goldfish
I suppose but...

383
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,392
I've learnt since and I've improved.

384
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:55,328
I love gherkins and I think it really
really gives

385
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,801
you have these in Germany?

386
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,461
Yeah they come from Germany

387
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,234
Is that where they come from?
What they called?

388
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,676
Well in Essex we call 'em wallies...

389
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:21,085
Anyway - capers right -just a nice
handful of capers. Drain the old water.

390
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,424
And you know what we're looking
for here by this stage

391
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:28,362
when we've chopped a bit is - same
parts - equal parts of capers,

392
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:32,367
gherkins and anchovies right.
As much garlic as you want to taste

393
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,171
yeah and then when you look
at that whole pile

394
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,436
that should make up like one part to sort
of four parts of the chopped herbs.

395
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,045
And if you do a bit more or a bit less
it's not the end of the world,

396
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,807
but what you're doing is varying the
flavours and the tanginess.

397
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:51,222
And you can vary it if you're serving it
with meat - or boiled roasted meats, fish

398
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,415
even sort of like grilled vegetables and
stuff like that are fantastic so...

399
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:57,584
that looks beautiful mate.
Just whack it in that glass bowl

400
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,696
there's some half decent
olive oil over there.

401
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:10,700
I add it to loosen really...
so quite a bit... little bit more

402
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:15,508
yeah that's lovely. Two big teaspoons of
that French mustard my old darling.

403
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:16,840
And that looks good mate.

404
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,473
So I'm gonna add all of this to here
and we just stir it all in

405
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,586
it's nice and loose with the olive oil
and that's what you want

406
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,881
so it's kind of you know it'll
just fall off the spoon.

407
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:28,890
But if you taste it now - it'll be
it'll be kind of bland yeah

408
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,391
so you need to liven it up a little bit.

409
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,826
You need something acid like vinegar
or lemon juice and

410
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:38,195
personally I prefer vinegar so start off
with about two tablespoons.

411
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,266
And when it's all mixed up
give it a little taste.

412
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,969
Little bit more. Can you put a bit
of salt in there my sweet?

413
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,971
Just do it to taste - but
talking about taste my old darling

414
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,914
show Pat your - your tongue ring...

415
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,017
Can you imagine having that
done to yourself

416
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,681
I mean I couldn't do that as a chef

417
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,158
because you'd lose all your
taste buds wouldn't you?

418
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,456
You don't at all - you don't taste
in the middle of the tongue

419
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:11,933
you just taste on the edges... like you
know - you don't taste in the middle.

420
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,503
It just seems a bit scary to have a
blooming great rod of metal

421
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:18,005
put through my tongue. Cool - taste...

422
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,303
Fine

423
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,641
Pucker - that'll be nice - that'll be
even better in about half an hour.
