1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,327
Naked's what I call my way of cooking.

2
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:05,663
What I cook in the restaurant isn't
what I cook at home.

3
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:07,971
Cooking's gotta be a laugh.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,902
It's gotta be simple

5
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:11,440
- it's gotta be tasty
- it's gotta be fun.

6
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:16,873
I suppose you could say it's stripping
down the recipe to its bare essentials.

7
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,210
No way - it's not me it's the food.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,027
Right I've gotta have something to eat
before I do anything else.

9
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:33,391
I'm gonna have a bacon sarnie for breakie

10
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:36,430
so what I've don't is I've got one of
the grill pans and they're quite cheap -

11
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:41,197
I use it all the time now just for like -
meat, fish - so easy.

12
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,441
Anyway look I've got this bread here -
and er -

13
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:45,906
I get 'em to slice it on the machine
but you know you get in there

14
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:48,706
and get a normal bread loaf and you
get it cut across into the normal round,

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,474
well I do it the other way and I say
can you put it through the long way.

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:57,213
So what you get is this... look at that...

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,879
Have you got a big day today then?

18
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:01,218
I've got a huge day.

19
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:03,918
I used to be in this band
when I was from 14 to 17 -

20
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:07,827
then I moved to London to sort of work
in the kitchens and stuff and er -

21
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:08,988
we never really spoke -

22
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,158
well we spoke on the phone every now
and again - that was it.

23
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:12,826
But about six months ago
they all moved to London -

24
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,938
so we kind of got it back together again.

25
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:16,897
We've got the first gig tonight mate.

26
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:18,770
What instrument do you play?

27
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:21,708
I'm a cliche drummer -
little bit hyperactive -

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,740
talks rubbish most of the time -
big fidgety - what can I say?

29
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:30,317
Right I'm just gonna push
this bacon to one side now

30
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:32,914
cos that's cooked and it looks lovely.

31
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:36,089
And I'm gonna get this bread
and I'm gonna toast it - on here -

32
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:39,321
instead of toasting it normally
I'm gonna toast it on this grill pan

33
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:41,295
and that's gonna suck up
a little bit of all -

34
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:44,162
the fat and the juices that
comes up from the bacon.

35
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:45,697
Do you always use white bread?

36
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:48,237
No - I don't - well - yeah.

37
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:50,201
I don't like brown bread.

38
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:52,739
My mum always tried to get me on it
but I don't like it at all.

39
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:55,412
Are the band coming back
to eat this evening?

40
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,138
Yeah I'm gonna cook er -

41
00:01:57,315 --> 00:02:00,682
a Thai green curry
which is pretty appropriate really

44
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,187
curries are kind of like the English boys

45
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:12,260
or Essex boys sort of ultimate after -
after pub food.

46
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:14,562
Right this is about done now.

47
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:19,794
Right I'm just gonna eat this
and then I've gotta go shopping

48
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:21,495
and get stuck in cos I've got a lot to do.

49
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:56,758
< THAI GREEN CURRY >

50
00:03:57,869 --> 00:04:00,133
So what I'm gonna make is
a Thai green curry yeah -

51
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:02,637
and for that we have
to make a green paste.

52
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:04,968
It's very quick to make
and very quick to cook.

53
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:07,202
Well there's a little bit of
preparation at this point er -

54
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,576
so what we're gonna do is
we've got spring onions here -

55
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:12,512
I use about five or six.

56
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:13,742
Could you use normal onion?

57
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,648
Yeah use normal onions -
shallots

58
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:19,012
and then lemon grass

59
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,590
basically what we want is the inside
where it's slightly white -

60
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,161
slightly softer - loads of flavour
- really zesty.

61
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,093
So I'm just gonna trim off the bottom

62
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:31,462
and then just trim off the end
until the tender quite of the root

63
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:33,570
which about normally about half way down

64
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:38,732
and you just want to strip the outside
leave off - cos they're quite tough.

65
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:42,278
It's a really delicate flavour - er -

66
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,610
and even if you just put in
with steamed rice

67
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:47,946
and stuff like that the flavour of it
really kicks all the way through.

68
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,313
It's lovely.

69
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:54,115
Split in half and
just cut into about four bits.

70
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:56,590
All these together make
a really good taste yeah

71
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:58,592
but if there's an ingredient
that you particularly like -

72
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:01,891
like I'm getting quite partial to
the old lime leaves -just up 'em a bit.

73
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:03,967
But this is -
this is a good one that I like.

74
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:05,567
Then I need some garlic.

75
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:08,297
Two or three -just peel 'em -
we can leave them whole.

76
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:11,266
Ooops - oh no -

77
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,112
Then I've got the ginger yeah -

78
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:21,252
thing to look out for when
you get the ginger is you want

79
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,546
a nice big fat old hand of ginger -

80
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:26,486
cos sometimes you have to root
around these poxy little bits

81
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:28,592
and they're just stringy
and dried up and horrible.

82
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,524
Nice thick bit - and just rip it off -

83
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:33,960
you can peel it with
a peeler or use a knife.

84
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:39,032
Right - so we wanna about that much
you know about a tablespoon's worth.

85
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:40,694
And that's another thing done.

86
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:46,769
Right we've got limes yeah -
lovely, lovely limes.

87
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:48,537
Just peel off a little bit of the skin

88
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:50,510
cos the skin's quite
fragrant and there's no -

89
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:52,616
you know no point in chucking it away.

90
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:55,218
I've got these really pucker chillies.

91
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:56,411
I'm gonna use about four or five -

92
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:59,284
again up it or lower
it as to what you like.

93
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,622
I'm just gonna take the ends off -
and I'm gonna cut them in half.

94
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:05,695
Do you think there's quite a macho element
into how hot you like your food?

95
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:08,731
Yeah - well -er - I suppose
when you go out with the boys

96
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,458
and you get a bit bevved - it does -

97
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:13,934
well - it's been know to turn into
a bit of a competition like

98
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:18,405
who can have the hottest curry,
but I just love chillies though so much.

99
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:22,034
The really really hot curries they use
the whole chillie which are these seeds,

100
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:24,613
but it's hot but it doesn't
really taste of chillie.

101
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:28,378
If you take the seeds out -
you get a nice warmth there -

102
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:30,850
but the actual taste
of chillie comes through.

103
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:34,480
Right so next we're gonna use lime leaves
and they're kind of unusual -

104
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:38,561
you get 'em in every single Thai
or Chinese supermarket

105
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,630
and you're starting to get 'em
in the supermarkets now

106
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:41,857
but these make such a difference -

107
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,591
they've got a really authentic flavour,

108
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:46,202
and I just wanna a little
handful like that much

109
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,771
and you buy them in bags like this
and you can freeze 'em

110
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,272
and they keep so well in the freezer.

111
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:53,343
Take any big bits of stalk that are off

112
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,741
and you just roll 'em up
like a little cigar and er -

113
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:02,012
just chuck 'em across -
just to help the machine a bit...

114
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:04,555
Right so I've this coriander here

115
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:08,556
and you know you want about sort of
three really good handfuls of this -

116
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:12,093
so that bunch is perfect and basil -

117
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:14,527
just rip the stalks off -
leave some of them on.

118
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,998
And we wanna about you know
two really good handfuls of basil -

119
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:20,228
so we've got lots of
fragrance there you know.

120
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:21,337
Coriander seeds -

121
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:25,067
about a little handful
or you know tablespoon

122
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,609
and a half and
just crack them in half -

123
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,212
you don't want to smash
'em up to a powder.

124
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:34,479
Lovely. Right this is the easy bit.

125
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:36,083
Just take it over to the mixer

126
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:39,620
get me olive oil.

127
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:43,857
Put my ginger and
the kind of the rougher things -

128
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:45,188
the sort of tougher things.

129
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:48,161
So I've got the garlic in there,
the garlic, the spring onions.

130
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:51,497
The things that are gonna give
the machine a little bit more work -

131
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:54,535
just pulse it up basically
as fine as you can.

132
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:04,242
Add a good good pinch of salt
and a bit of pepper -

133
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:06,984
coriander in - coriander seeds.

134
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,579
Right so just cut these limes in half
and just squeeze all the juice in there -

135
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:16,958
all these herbs -
...just push it all down.

136
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:22,055
Put about two tablespoons -
three tablespoons worth of oil in.

137
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:26,965
Just leave it go for a couple of minutes.

138
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:32,608
Basically that's done now.
It smells absolutely outrageous.

139
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:34,769
Will you use all that paste for the curry?

140
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,004
I probably will use all this paste

141
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:37,705
cos I want you know
I'm gonna put coconut milk in -

142
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:41,045
I want lots of sort of juice -
but I tell you what -

143
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,948
even if I'm cooking for myself -

144
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,155
I still cook this much

145
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:47,348
because all you have to do is jar
it in an airtight container -

146
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:49,925
bit of oil over the top
so the air doesn't get to it

147
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,153
and it keeps for weeks in the fridge.

148
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,329
Right - I've got this really
nice chicken breasts yeah -

149
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,765
they're free range of course -
but you know get what you can.

150
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:01,797
Would you use the green paste
with any different sort of curry -

151
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:03,031
you don't have to use chicken?

152
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,072
The green paste? - 

153
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:06,369
Oh God the green paste -
you can do so much with this -

154
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:08,136
I mean you can basically -

155
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:12,014
you can marinate like kebabs or something

156
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:15,448
and just have the paste on its own
and like barbecue it in the summer -

157
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,781
just put some lime juice
over it afterwards.

158
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:21,083
Use it with prawns to do
sort of prawn curries - er -

159
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,785
sort of you know
just brush bits of fish with it

160
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:26,430
and just sort of grill it really quickly.

161
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:28,463
So I'm just gonna cut them
at a sort of angle -

162
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:31,500
quite big bits and that'll make
a sort of a big bit of surface area

163
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,899
so it can have a nice
marinade clinging to it.

164
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,039
I'm gonna take about
I suppose a spoonful -

165
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,938
a couple of tablespoons of the m...
of the paste -

166
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:42,304
and -just put that in there.

167
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,506
I'm gonna put the chicken in with it
and I'm just gonna toss it over

168
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,314
and I only want it to lightly coat it.

169
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:50,078
So you don't put the chicken
in all the marinade?

170
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:52,587
No cos I just -
I want the flavour to impregnate the meat

171
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:54,156
I also want to just give it that -

172
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:57,055
initially when I cook it
I wanna give it that sear in a wok -

173
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:59,455
and if I've got too much of this
in it it's gonna boil.

174
00:09:59,964 --> 00:10:00,726
Lovely - so this -

175
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:02,729
I'm gonna give this about
20 minutes of marinade -

176
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,425
that's the minimum
you wanna give it really.

177
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:08,071
But anything from 20 minutes
to 2 hours is great.

178
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:12,408
Right so I'm gonna cook the curry now -
it's very very simple.

179
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:13,475
I've got a hot wok -

180
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,237
get your meat ready -
get your paste ready.

181
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:16,812
Coconut milk - nearly forgot.

182
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:19,480
Put my oil straight in -
put it round the sides.

183
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:20,747
What sort of oil is that?

184
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:23,682
Just normal sort of vegetable oil.
In with the meat -

185
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:28,785
And just like - push it about -

186
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:34,026
we're just gonna cook it
like this for about 2/3 minutes -

187
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:38,225
just so we searing a little bit of colour
in and that - that's nice for flavour.

188
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,236
If you didn't have a wok could you do it
a saucepan or something?

189
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:42,031
Yeah of course you can -

190
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:45,073
do it in like a casserole type pan -
get it really hot again.

191
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:49,806
Exactly the same and then -
I'm gonna get this paste -

192
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:53,547
get it all in there and this is
where really you stop frying -

193
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:56,312
and start sort of boiling it now.

194
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:58,648
So just smear over that green paste.

195
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:05,491
Just for like 30 seconds or something
and then we'll add this coconut milk.

196
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:10,124
Brilliant.

197
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:12,559
And just stir it all in...

198
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:15,939
right - so basically
I'm gonna bring it to the boil -

199
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,131
right - let it simmer
for about 12/13 minutes -

200
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,540
just until the chicken's nice and tender -
and er - that's it - it's done.

201
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:26,514
Just season it to taste - a bit of lime -
get some sort of shaved coconut in there -

202
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:31,883
chopped pistachios nuts and some coriander
just to freshen it up at the last minute

203
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:34,923
and I think the band will really -
I think they're gonna love it.

204
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:36,492
< SALAD >

205
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:39,428
< SALAD >

206
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:43,726
I'm gonna make this really excellent
salad that goes with the green curry -

207
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:48,565
the green curry being quite fragrant
and hot and this salad being quite clean.

208
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,708
So what I've got here is
just some really nice

209
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:55,471
deep red perfectly ripe cherry tomatoes
and I'm just cutting them in quarters -

210
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:57,307
you can do 'em in halves if you want.

211
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,575
I've got a fresh coconut -

212
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,844
we don't want any of that
desiccated stuff.

213
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:06,280
Er - and as you can buy
these absolutely anywhere -

214
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:08,152
markets - supermarkets - whatever -

215
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:10,954
it's much better and much
more authentic to use these.

216
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,120
If you wanna keep the milk you can -

217
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,832
We put -
we only actually need half a coconut.

218
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:27,075
I can save this and scrap it
onto the curry later or just keep it.

219
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:28,341
Do something else with it.

220
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:29,878
So just cut if up into bits -

221
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:34,677
and slice it as thinly as possible
in any old fashion really.

222
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:36,877
You can see it's such a wicked colour.

223
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,616
Really tasty and...

224
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:43,620
tastes so much different
to the dried stuff -

225
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:45,126
don't even think about it.

226
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:47,661
Different textures as well -
it's not just taste.

227
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,092
Lovely - right so just chuck this in.

228
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,703
Next thing you need is we've got cucumber

229
00:12:55,006 --> 00:13:00,467
and I need about - about half a cucumber.

230
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:03,212
Just peel this and then
I'm gonna cut it in half

231
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:08,149
and we want to remove this little bit
in here which is really watery -

232
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:09,809
tastes of kind of nothing really.

233
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,922
Really don't want it -
and you get a spoon -

234
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:15,353
scoop it out or you can get a knife -

235
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:19,587
just go in at an angle very gently -
go in at an angle here.

236
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:22,028
Just kind of turf it out and
just kind of use your fingers

237
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,067
till you can see all that -
just water - you don't want that.

238
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:27,966
I quite like to sort of cut it
in half again -

239
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,505
just do it in thin like kind
of length ways bits like that

240
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:34,941
and then just cut it in half again -
I just kind of think that size is perfect.

241
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:37,273
You know you want it the same as the...?

242
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:40,212
What else might you serve this salad with?

243
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:43,578
Well it's a very refreshing salad
so you always do it with light things -

244
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:44,812
things like er -

245
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:50,086
simply grilled piece of fish -
you know white fish preferably.

246
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:52,893
Simply grilled chicken - er -

247
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:56,932
cheeses you know - feta cheese,
ricotta, mozzarella - really nice.

248
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:59,126
Yeah just -just simple things really.

249
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:02,602
Er - So what we're gonna do now -
I've got some nice basil -

250
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:05,435
really fragrant that I bought
and I've washed it -

251
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,510
I just wanna about that much and that's -

252
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:09,612
it's quite strong and it's really fresh

253
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,078
and we're gonna get loads and loads
of flavour our of that so just -

254
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,017
just slice it up -
get that stuck in there.

255
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:18,814
Like you can smell it already
do you know what I mean? - 

256
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,752
It's lovely jubbly.

257
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:21,357
Could you use any other herbs?

258
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:26,054
Yep - you could use coriander
which is lovely - coriander and basil -

259
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:28,892
but I've got a lot of coriander
in the green curry

260
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:30,431
and I wanna keep the flavours separate

261
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:32,694
so I think that makes sense
do you know what I mean.

262
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,465
Right so what I wanna do now is dress -
dress it like a normal salad -

263
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:39,608
a good pinch of pepper -
a good pinch of salt -

264
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:42,439
and I'm gonna use limes -
two limes and that's gonna give it a -

265
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,638
as opposed to lemon
it's gonna be really zingy.

266
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:47,784
Something that will help get the juice
out is just to put your weight on it

267
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:51,979
and roll it like that - roll it off and...

268
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:55,751
you've got that fragrance of the skin
straight away and you can peel the skin -

269
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:58,828
finely chop it and just put it
in a pan with some fish -

270
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:00,964
panned fried fish or something like that -
that'll work brilliantly.

271
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:02,565
But I don't want the skin.

272
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:05,566
I just want the juice and
just shove your hand inside

273
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:07,601
and give it a good old squeeze.

274
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:16,708
And then you wanna put about the same
amount of olive oil as the lime juice -

275
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:20,417
er - and now just give it
a little toss over.

276
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:25,278
Or you can mix it -
or get your hand stuck in -

277
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:28,425
just toss it over and
the colours are amazing

278
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:30,458
and what we're gonna do now
is just put your finger at the bottom

279
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:32,653
where all the kind of dressing
dripping down to -

280
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:38,434
and taste it - little bit more salt -
just so everything's like perfectly...

281
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:43,698
bit of pepper and -
I think - an optional now -

282
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:48,002
which I think I'll go for is er -
a little bit of chillie -

283
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:53,344
just split them in half and
scrap the seeds out the middle.

284
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:55,644
It gives it a little bit of heat -
not hot -

285
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,584
I'm not talking anywhere
near blowing your head off -

286
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:01,691
but what I'm talking about is
a really really nice sort of warmth

287
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:06,353
that works with the cucumbers and
the tomatoes and the limes and it just -

288
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,522
I think it brings it
all together really well.

289
00:16:13,137 --> 00:16:18,404
Yeah - this will sit quite happily
for a bit of time -

290
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:22,342
letting all the sort of flavours
come out of the chillies

291
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:24,981
and everything to combine a bit

292
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:27,379
and it's you know
it's a really colourful thing -

293
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:29,685
in the middle of the table - lovely.

294
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:54,893
Right to go with my pucker curry right
I'm gonna make the perfect rice

295
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:56,532
and I know everyone knows
how to make rice -

296
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,931
but this is a special way that
I use to make it really light

297
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:01,833
and really fluffy and I like it.

298
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:03,505
Boil up the rice -

299
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:07,105
in boiling salted water
for about 4 or 5 minutes

300
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:10,247
and then at that stage the rice
is just slightly under cooked

301
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:12,345
and I put a little bit of
water back in the pan -

302
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:19,823
put the colander over it -
and whack it back on there.

303
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:22,450
Bit of tin foil over and basically -

304
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:26,026
water's draining off now and
it's gonna come to the boil

305
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:30,600
and start steaming again and that's gonna
really help to make it lovely and light -

306
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:34,260
takes about five minutes and then
it'll be perfectly ready to eat.

307
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:38,608
< TEMPURA AND DIPPING SAUCE >

308
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,568
What I'm gonna make now
is a thing called tempura

309
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:44,612
which is basically is a really
really pucker crispy batter

310
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:48,616
and you can deep fry like
vegetables or meat or fish

311
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:51,152
but I'm gonna do vegetables
today with dipping sauces

312
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:52,846
and I think it's
the dipping sauce that really -

313
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:54,991
you got that big crunch and
you've got the lovely inside

314
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,525
but the dipping sauce is what you want
and I'll show you how to make -

315
00:19:57,695 --> 00:20:00,027
it's very, very simple and
you can vary it any old way.

316
00:20:00,197 --> 00:20:02,461
I've got rice wine vinegar here.

317
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:05,667
Rice wine vinegar's slightly more
mild than like white wine vinegar

318
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:07,201
but I mean you can use it.

319
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:08,565
What you've got to do is sweeten it

320
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:10,934
and it's very simple and
you can just do it to your own taste.

321
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:12,905
So if you just get a little bowl.

322
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,671
I'm gonna put in about half a pint okay -

323
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:23,182
and I'm gonna add about three kind
of dessertspoons of sugar to this

324
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,755
and you just stir it until it goes clear.

325
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:28,616
Just keep tasting - and -

326
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,190
what you wanna do is take that
harshness out of the vinegar -

327
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,627
so it's just beautiful for dipping.

328
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:39,199
Put a little bit more in I think - yeah.

329
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:42,496
Right so you've got your sweet
and sour there - that's there.

330
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,140
What we need to do now is get
loads and loads of flavour.

331
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:48,134
I've got coriander here -
just a little handful -

332
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,646
and this is how easy it is you know.

333
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:54,477
I'm just gonna chop it up
and whop it in there.

334
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:59,413
And I want some chillies -
just scrap out most of the seeds.

335
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:02,083
How did - how did the gig go?

336
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:03,783
The gig was superb mate honestly -

337
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:06,691
it was such a cracker
and it was a real laugh.

338
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:09,964
Got a bit sweaty though -
I like to get into it a bit.

339
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:15,869
Right kind of finelyish chopped -
in it goes.

340
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:18,704
Now garlic's quite important actually -

341
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:21,743
not much but just a little bit of garlic -

342
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:24,146
not garlic that's gonna
punch you round the face

343
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:26,283
but garlic that just kind
of changes the flavour -

344
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,647
it gives you that kind of -
I'm talking like a wine merchant -

345
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:35,825
And I probably use a quarter -
so just finely chop it -

346
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:39,893
and that'll be enough to make it
completely taste different.

347
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,189
Give it a good old stir round -

348
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:46,802
Right - yeah wicked.

349
00:21:47,504 --> 00:21:49,199
Those flavours are really strong.

350
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:51,267
But of salt and pepper -

351
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:55,374
always important and
that tastes alright now -

352
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:57,376
but give it like ten minutes
or give it an hour -

353
00:21:57,548 --> 00:21:58,515
that'll be like a tea-bag -

354
00:21:58,682 --> 00:22:00,843
there'll be loads of flavours
all over the place.

355
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:02,016
So that's the dipping sauce done?

356
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:04,916
Yeah - end of story.

357
00:22:06,957 --> 00:22:09,448
Just going to put it into
some little bowls - and er -

358
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:14,590
I'll put them in the middle of the table
and they can just dip away.

359
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:21,670
< TEMPURA >

360
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:23,564
Now I'm gonna make the batter -

361
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:25,971
very important you've gotta
make it last minute.

362
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,341
All you need is cornflour
and plain or strong flour.

363
00:22:31,515 --> 00:22:36,282
And what I need to do is I need
double normal flour to cornflour -

364
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:40,219
so it's one cup of cornflour
to two lots of normal flour.

365
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:43,816
Lovely - right okay.

366
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:48,225
We need water,
okay but we need ice cold water and if -

367
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:49,866
if you've got it hanging about -

368
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:54,437
fizzy mineral water or soda water
seems to give it a little bit of an edge.

369
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:58,769
But if not you know cold - very cold -
ice cold water is perfect.

370
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:01,071
It has to be ice cold?

371
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:02,769
It just helps it - it's like -

372
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:06,143
imagine we're gonna deep fry it yeah -
very hot -

373
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:08,011
imagine something
really cold hitting that -

374
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:12,019
it's just gonna go - straight away
it's gonna make it really crunchy so...

375
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:21,498
Some water - swish it around a bit -
let it cold cold.

376
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:21,994
Now -

377
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,793
this is the important bit about tempura.

378
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:24,558
We're not gonna let it -

379
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:28,227
we're not gonna make it and
let it rest like normal batters right.

380
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:30,163
We wanna make it right
at the last minute -

381
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,275
we're not gonna whip it
with a whish so it's really smooth -

382
00:23:33,444 --> 00:23:35,776
I'm gonna use like the back
of a spoon of a chopstick

383
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:38,141
and what that'll give you
is kind of a lump batter

384
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:39,714
and I know that sounds really freaky

385
00:23:39,883 --> 00:23:42,283
but the little lumps help
to make it really crispy

386
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:45,320
and it's quite characteristic
of tempura in general really.

387
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:47,514
Right so this -
this water's really cold now -

388
00:23:47,691 --> 00:23:53,288
so what I'm gonna do is just pour it in -
add it bit by bit - stir it in slowly -

389
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:01,832
You want it to be about double cream -

390
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,565
just slightly thicker than
double cream consistency -

391
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,571
Lovely - that's perfect -
absolutely stunning.

392
00:24:08,745 --> 00:24:11,543
Right so I've gotta wicked
selection of vegetable here.

393
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:14,343
I've got green beans, I've got chillies -
I've got mushrooms - I've got courgettes -

394
00:24:14,518 --> 00:24:16,850
I've not asparagus -
we've got sweet potato - I've got onions.

395
00:24:17,387 --> 00:24:19,947
I've got broccoli -
you know herbs - little corns -

396
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:23,491
so just get a bit of everything in there -
you don't want to overload the frying oil

397
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,390
so just kind of do little bits
at a time and use your -

398
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:29,828
your chop stick to kind of just
fold it all over -just to coat it.

399
00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:34,796
And shake off any excess if there is any -
and this oil -

400
00:24:34,972 --> 00:24:37,770
I've got hot oil here and
it's been heating up slowly -

401
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:40,307
this is at 200 - 220 degrees

402
00:24:40,477 --> 00:24:43,002
It you haven't got a thermometer -
you can get 'em for about five quid -

403
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,080
all you have to do is dip it in

404
00:24:45,315 --> 00:24:48,079
and if it kind of starts
to fry quite fast that's fine -

405
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:50,152
if it's a really viscous
fry you don't want that

406
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,083
and if it's not frying at all -
then it's too cold.

407
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:53,985
So just keep your eyes peeled.

408
00:24:54,858 --> 00:24:55,950
Kind of flick it away from you -

409
00:24:56,126 --> 00:24:59,493
just so that if any like splashes of oil
come in they don't go anywhere near your.

410
00:24:59,897 --> 00:25:00,659
What sort of oil is it?

411
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:02,822
It's just normal like sunflower oil.

412
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,724
So you get your first load in quick -

413
00:25:04,902 --> 00:25:06,767
otherwise they'll all be cooked
at different times.

414
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:10,135
What's your favourite vegetable in it?

415
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:12,172
I reckon my favourite
must be the chillies -

416
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:17,370
the mushrooms and the sweet potatoes -
I just love those - so good. So so tasty.

417
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:20,976
Right so I'm just gonna use one of
these things just to turn it over a bit

418
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:24,548
and don't be viscous with it
but just kind of like turn 'em over -

419
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:27,349
make sure they're not sticking -
move 'em about a little bit

420
00:25:27,524 --> 00:25:30,220
and I just feel already
they're really really crispy.

421
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:32,856
The only thing that determines

422
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,760
how you should cut things up
is like for instance -

423
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:39,130
that batter cooks in about two and a half,
three minutes okay -

424
00:25:39,303 --> 00:25:41,328
to be perfectly crisp
and slightly golden -

425
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:43,666
right and things like the asparagus
tips and the courgettes

426
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,037
and the chillie they're all gonna
be perfectly edible in that time.

427
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:50,874
But things like sweet potatoes
which are quite hard er -

428
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:51,980
because of the three minutes -

429
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:55,209
you've gotta cut it to a thickness
which is gonna be you know nice

430
00:25:55,385 --> 00:25:56,784
and edible in three minutes you know -

431
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:59,980
so something like that -
sort of like thick kind of crisp.

432
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:04,091
So these are ready -

433
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:09,255
so just shake off the excess oil and
then lay it out on the paper - wicked.

434
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:12,295
I'm really pleased with these so basically

435
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:15,734
what I'm gonna do now is put
a little bit of salt on them -

436
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:19,069
cos I thing that makes lovely
jubbly and just test one.

437
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:28,607
Mmm - hot and crispy - Mmm - perfect.

438
00:26:28,785 --> 00:26:30,685
Right I'm gonna get on now
and cook these in batches

439
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:32,344
and I wanna keep feeding the old troops

440
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:34,888
cos they're ravenous now
so I'm gonna crack on.
