1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,363
Naked's what I call my way of cooking.

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:05,697
What I cook in the restaurant isn't
what I cook at home.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,098
Cooking's gotta be a laugh.

4
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:08,899
It's gotta be simple

5
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:11,202
- it's gotta be tasty
- it's gotta be fun.

6
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,873
I suppose you could say it's stripping
down the recipe to its bare essentials.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,111
No way it's not me it's the food.

8
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,609
Must be a special occasion Jamie
if you're having your hair cut?

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,211
It's my birthday.

10
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,879
I'm having a party -
have a load of mates round

11
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,553
so I thought I'd have my mop chopped -
make a bit of an effort you know.

12
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,949
So you cooking for everyone?

13
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:59,057
Yeah yeah - I've got 'em all coming round
about 30 or 40 or them so...

14
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,126
I wanna keep it simple -
I've got big loin of pork -

15
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:06,129
slice it up - big salad, salsas -
shoved in a pitta bread -

16
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,233
posh kebabs mate - it'll be pucker.

17
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:58,516
< ROAST LOIN OF PORK >

18
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,286
Look at this -

19
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,421
now the butcher's done
all the hard work for me.

20
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,683
All I did was walk in the shop
say can I have a loin of pork -

21
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,554
can I have it scored -
can I have it off the bone -

22
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,355
and can you chop the bones up for me?
It's all done - no mess.

23
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,998
So all I want to do is do
some really simple things

24
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,465
to make it really taste superb -
I mean I'm just gonna roast it as normal.

25
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,104
So first thing I'm gonna
get some fennel seeds -

26
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:23,599
just about a couple of tablespoons
and just smash these up...

27
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,041
Pork's really good value and
this is a nice free range bit of pork

28
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,011
and it's you know - it didn't -

29
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,174
didn't really costs me
too much considering

30
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,980
I'm gonna feed about like
30/40 people with it -

31
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,183
These fennel seeds -

32
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,621
just sprinkle it onto the flesh
on the bottom yeah -

33
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,124
it's quite a nice fresh flavour - er -

34
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:46,288
and you know I think it complements
pork quite well - so pat that in.

35
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:51,128
If you didn't want to use this much...
could you use a smaller joint or?

36
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,772
Yeah yeah -
I mean I've got a big joint of pork

37
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,373
cos I've got loads of people coming round,

38
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,943
but do a half loin - do a quarter loin -
even if it's for two or three people -

39
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,636
do a quarter of a loin of pork

40
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,940
and then when it's cooled down
put it in the fridge -

41
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,880
it'll last for about 2/3 days -
really nice in sandwiches -

44
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,083
the kind of the more of
the point of roasting you lose -

45
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:14,783
you know what I mean -

46
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,292
you might as well just fry it
or grill it then.

47
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,530
So these garlic cloves -
I've just broken up the whole bulb

48
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,133
and I'm just gonna kind of
smash it a little bit -

49
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,004
just to kind of squash it really -
not smash it into a paste.

50
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,941
Then just scoop it out
and rub it onto this meat

51
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,408
and it doesn't look it's gonna do a lot

52
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,572
but it will infuse
an immediate bit of flavour.

53
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:41,413
So - so we've done that -
then just turn it round -

54
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,216
and I'm gonna get some rosemary into these
lovely cracks do you know what I mean?

55
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,953
So as opposed to just having
lovely crackling salt -

56
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,324
I'm gonna get rosemary in these
little gaps and then just -

57
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,398
ah it's just gonna be so tasty.

58
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,633
So that's the pork crackling
there on the top?

59
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah - this is the skin and I've scored -
and the butcher's scored it -

60
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,501
so when that cooks and
the fat gets going in between

61
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,042
and I've got like rosemary in there it's
gonna start sort of getting all greasy

62
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,147
and fatty and bubbling away and
the skin's going to souffle up

63
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,909
and all that rosemary flavour's
gonna go straight into it.

64
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:18,047
Pull of the nice sort of tender little
bits really and get rid of all the stalks.

65
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,061
All you wanna do is just
chop up the rosemary

66
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,629
so it's just fine enough
to get into those...

67
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,966
nothing exact and then kind of
sprinkle it over the skin

68
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,736
and the idea really is to get it
all in the gaps and not on top

69
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,968
because even though it doesn't matter
if it's on top it'll burn

70
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,238
and you won't sort of benefit
any flavour out there.

71
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,346
So just kind of rub it in.

72
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,314
Are you gonna serve this hot or cold?

73
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,821
Well I'm gonna serve it hot but you
know it doesn't matter if it's cold.

74
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,255
I think pork's wicked
hot or cold you know.

75
00:04:55,662 --> 00:05:01,692
Right - what we gotta do now is do
a kind of little marinade - er - and...

76
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,797
we've got a nice big tray.

77
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,639
In that tray I'm gonna put
all the left over bits of flavour

78
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,368
that haven't quite gone into the pork -
all the rosemary - all the garlic -

79
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:16,277
little bits of fennel seed
and quite simply put er -

80
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,508
a good lug of balsamic vinegar -

81
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:22,121
just enough to sort of thinly
cover the bottom of the er - tray.

82
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,183
There you go - and some olive oil.

83
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,057
Right so I'm gonna get some bay leaf -

84
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,367
and these are really nice flavour
so I just pick some of these off -

85
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,733
so just kind of rip them up
into the bottom of the tray -

86
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:50,576
and then what I'm gonna do
is just put this lion - flesh side down -

87
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,981
not skin side down cos anything
that gets on the skin will burn

88
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,087
and we want to have
lovely golden crackling.

89
00:05:56,255 --> 00:06:00,123
But the flesh side we wanna suck up
all those lovely flavours,

90
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,052
and just leave it for about half an hour.

91
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,094
Right so this pork's had
about half an hour now -

92
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,859
doesn't really look much different
on top cos it hasn't touched it -

93
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,730
but on the bottom it looks a bit different

94
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,928
and it'll definitely
taste a lot different.

95
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,269
So what I'm gonna do is
just push it to one side er -

96
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,839
get a nice big pinch of salt...

97
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,105
on top and that'll make it crackle
and go really nice.

98
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,182
And then a bit underneath
to season the meat as well.

99
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,719
And these bones that I've got chopped up -

100
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,358
I just put in a line -

101
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:41,859
and then just move the pork onto that
and it'll lift the meat off -

102
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,798
off the marinade cos you don't want it
to boil do you know what I mean -

103
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,336
you want it to roast...

104
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,500
So the meat juices then fall through...?

105
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:54,510
Yeah cos basically what's gonna happen now
is the juices will cook out the pork -

106
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,046
go into all that lovely marinade
which has got olive oil in it

107
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,740
and it's gonna be like
a kind of really sticky,

108
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,749
tasty kind of dressing type thing -

109
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,320
which will be really nice
to dribble over sliced meat later.

110
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,787
I can't imagine how that's
gonna look like a kebab?

111
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,654
No but the thing is when it's cooked
I'm gonna slice it nice and thinly -

112
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:14,266
put it on a plate - little bit of salad -
little bit of salsa, pitta bread -

113
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,766
It seems such an extraordinary thing
to be cooking at home?

114
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,925
Kebabs?

115
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,334
Oh mate - I know that a lot of chefs
are a bit kind of proud

116
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,268
but I'm not too proud -

117
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,965
I like a bit of tacky
every now and again -

118
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,804
so no - I love kebabs -
it's gonna be perfect for tonight.

119
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,879
Yeah - so basically
I've got my oven on full whack -

120
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,310
I'm gonna put it in for an hour -

121
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,043
after the first 20 minutes
I'm gonna turn it down to 220

122
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,585
so it kind of cooks nice and sort of fast

123
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,918
but slightly more gentle and
it'll be really nice and crispy

124
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,821
and golden on top and
the meat will just be perfect.

125
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,862
< SALSA >

126
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:55,202
Okay to go with my posh pork kebabs - er
I'm gonna make like a funky little salsa

127
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,707
which I suppose is replacement
for the old chilli sauce -

128
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:03,679
so I'm gonna plonk in the old peppers -
er - right on the gas -

129
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,684
gas hob and that's gonna
kind of sear the skin -

130
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,322
and I just find it quicker
to do it like this on the gas

131
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,891
as opposed to in the grill
or you know to roast it.

132
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,890
To those two peppers I need
about half a medium sized red onion -

133
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,663
cos they're quite nice and sweet anyway.

134
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,630
And I'm just gonna finely chop it.

135
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,674
That's that done -
and then I've got three large chilies -

136
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,308
so I'm just gonna cut them in half,

137
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,848
and kind of poke out the er -
the seeds and then finely chop them.

138
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,253
Let's turn one of these.

139
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,480
Look at that so you wanna get them nice
and black like that.

140
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,951
You should only have to turn it
three times really

141
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,389
cos peppers normally have bout
three or four sides...

142
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,089
And what are you gonna
give people to drink?

143
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,336
Oh God! - Well we're gonna have
the normal beer and wine but er -

144
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:03,236
I've got my mate Damian coming round -
he's a really good barman and er -

145
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,671
he's quite good at cocktails.

146
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,971
In actual fact he's very good at cocktails

147
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,706
and he's gotta couple of little
surprises up his sleeve for me.

148
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,373
I don't know anything about cocktails - er

149
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,913
I know - he's gonna come round in a van

150
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,155
and we're gonna pick up
our shipment of booze.

151
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,453
That looks like an awful lot of chilli?

152
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,958
Yeah but these big ones
aren't very strong you know.

153
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,927
You adding them to taste really -
the idea is that's it's quite crunchy

154
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:29,329
and quite twangy and quite hot
and loads of flavour.

155
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:36,471
One garlic clove just finely chop it -
...really fine.

156
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,406
Lovely - let's get all that in there.

157
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,281
Let's have a look at these - brilliant.

158
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,814
Er - Yeah we're done.

159
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:49,284
So - some people put the old er -
peppers once they're really blackened -

160
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,913
some people put 'em in plastic bags or -
er - sandwich bags -

161
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,788
but I just chuck 'em in a bowl - and er

162
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,462
- cover them in cling film and
they'll start to steam you can see it

163
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,099
and then when I come back to it
in sort of five minutes time -

164
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,237
the inside will be lovely and sweet -

165
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:10,307
soft and the outside the skin
will just pull away really easy.

166
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,673
Right I'm gonna put some fresh parsley
and some basil in here.

167
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,447
I'm not gonna be fussy with it I'm just
gonna take the worst of the stalk off -

168
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,549
and then kind of roll it up -

169
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:30,560
so it's all kind of compacted
and then I'm gonna finely chop it.

170
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,797
Here we go.

171
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,460
I know it's your birthday Jamie but does -
does your party have a particular theme?

172
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,365
No there's no theme -

173
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,665
I just wanna get all my old mates
together really - have a good laugh.

174
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,805
I don't - I'm not really all that
keen on theme parties because -

175
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,036
well I had a terrible experience once -

176
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:51,115
I - it was my mate's 20th birthday
and it was cross dressing party.

177
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,411
Don't ask me why -
it wasn't my idea - and er -

178
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,179
all the girls came as blokes -

179
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,756
I went as a woman and I made such
an ugly woman you wouldn't believe

180
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,620
and I was in a luminous -

181
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,457
luminous green skirt and
skirt and shirt number -

182
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:09,397
and er - I decided to walk home
at the end of the night

183
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,695
and I had to keep diving
in the ditches cos -

184
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,135
cos cars kept coming along and
I didn't want them to see me.

185
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,637
And I didn't tell anyone that I'd left -

186
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,836
and they just found my handbag and
the inside of my bra next to the pond

187
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,573
and everyone thought I'd drowned and they
were digging around trying to find me.

188
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,081
So I won't ever be doing that again.

189
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,779
Right - so just add about sort of five
or six tablespoons of olive oil -

190
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,446
just enough to sort of loosen it up
and make it lovely and shiny.

191
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,918
And then these peppers
should be ready so basically

192
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,655
we just wanna kind of pull away the skin

193
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:43,529
and that's really easy now
we've kind of steamed them a little bit.

194
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,570
You sometimes you see people
wash them under the tap cos it's -

195
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,299
they think it's easier and
it's just damn lazy really

196
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,239
and you wash all the lovely
sweetness away - so don't do that.

197
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,902
Anyway - a little - little bit of
black skin left of them is quite nice

198
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:59,017
cos it tastes quite chary and -
barbecuey - which is pretty funky.

199
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,186
What we have to do now is cut it in half -

200
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,844
and you should be able
to pull out the once.

201
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,649
Ah they're hot!

202
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,594
Yeah it's an idea to let them get...

203
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:14,199
- ah - it's an idea
to let them get a bit cooler.

204
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:20,730
Ah - get rid of all the pips.

205
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:26,005
And then just chop it along
- right nearly there.

206
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,237
And that looks yum yum.

207
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:34,079
So right so scrape it all in. In we go.

208
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:41,216
That looks superb and all we have
to do now is kind of correct it all -

209
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:47,923
so good pinch of salt and
a really generous twisting of pepper.

210
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,905
Lovely! - 

211
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,972
and actually I tell you
what the other trick is -

212
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,838
nice little lug of red wine vinegar

213
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,640
because it's got
a really nice twang and er -

214
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,339
kind of gives it that kick -

215
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:08,146
that little kick that we like with
the chilli and all that funky stuff.

216
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,887
Right so - mmm -
I'm really pleased with that.

217
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,517
Tastes really good now -

218
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,092
but if you come back
to it in about an hour

219
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,559
when it's all had time
to kind of amalgamate

220
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,995
and mix up and all the flavours are
kind of getting right in there - er -

221
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,694
give it another bit of salt and pepper
and er - that'll be really good.

222
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,352
Hello mate.

223
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,821
Where do you get the van?

224
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,122
Ah borrowed it off my mum.

225
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,998
What is she a builder or something?

226
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,259
I'm in a party mood mate -
how you feeling?

227
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,398
Wicked.

228
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,056
Promise me you're gonna
give me a hand with these punches

229
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,724
cos I'm useless I don't know
what I'm doing.

230
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,801
Definitely.

231
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,567
Right I've got to shoot off - get changed
but can you make that sugar syrup -

232
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,176
Yeah yeah yeah - orange isn't it?

233
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,905
Yeah orange and a bit of mint...
Thank for that - see you soon.

234
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,589
< CHILLI AND MOzARELLA >

235
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,025
This mozzarella and chilli salad
is absolutely superb -

236
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,751
it's definitely one of my favourites.

237
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,987
Get it really good -

238
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,790
what I have to do is
just blacken the chillies -

239
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,492
exactly the same as I did the peppers
and I just have to prick the skin first

240
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,604
cos I had a bit of dodgy experience once
when I was at work

241
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,538
and I was grilling
about 30 chillies and er -

242
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,676
all of a sudden they started exploding -
I mean like really like hot hot exploding

243
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,941
all over my face and
it really really burnt.

244
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,553
So got to prick 'em first
and then they won't do it.

245
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,516
But they smell wicked.

246
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:00,956
I love chillies anyway -

247
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,527
but like when you've got that
milkiness of the cold sort of mozzarella

248
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:10,260
and the kind of sweet hot chillies - like
- to me it's just like - I just love it.

249
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,698
I love it to bits.

250
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,497
Also I've got quite a few veggies -
well quite a few -

251
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,300
I've got a couple of veggies
coming tonight so -

252
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,841
I want them to able to put
something in their pitta bread -

253
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,069
you know have something
substantial to eat.

254
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,507
These are basically ready now -

255
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,277
we just wanna make them sweet
and make the skin come off quick.

256
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,387
So I just pop in the pot and er -
cling film it.

257
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,682
And leave that for about five minutes.

258
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,524
Er - and what I'm gonna do now -
is I've got some nice mozzarella -

259
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,857
but I reckon the key
to make this a really good salad -

260
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,936
I mean it sounds a bit funny
is to have a nice big plate yeah -

261
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,335
and then er - instead of cutting
the mozzarella up which looks -

262
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:53,274
I think a bit plasticy -
just rip it up - and old fashion really -

263
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,573
I mean into quarters
is kind of a good idea.

264
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,484
Just so it looks a bit more
natural and a bit kind of more -

265
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,549
I don't know rustic I suppose.

266
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,517
I just think it looks funky.

267
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,222
Right there you go -
now these chillies you can see 'em -

268
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,726
they've been steaming a little bit and
there's loads of condensation inside.

269
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,965
I just test one and see
if the skin wants to come off.

270
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,634
Yeah lovely.

271
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,169
Right - er - they're really easy to peel.

272
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,900
You just push away the skin -
comes off really easy.

273
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:30,108
So what we wanna do now is get -
just take the ends off the chilli -

274
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,613
cut them in half -

275
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:36,415
they smell absolutely fantastic
and I just scrap all the seeds out -

276
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,556
right which is obviously
the really harsh hot bit -

277
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,320
So what you're left with
is fairly mild then is it?

278
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,224
Yeah reasonably mild -

279
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,126
I'll try one in a minute
and if I'm wrong -

280
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,860
I mean all chillies are different -
from different parts of the world - er -

281
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,363
and I've been eating chillies raw
one minute sort of really easily

282
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,441
and then the next week
we get a similar looking batch in

283
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:58,507
and they're from
a different part of the country

284
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,941
and you nosh into one and it's like ah! - 

285
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,048
And it's just like awful but -
no I think these will be alright -

286
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,844
and I jut basically slice them lengthways.

287
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,988
So if you make a really
really hot chilli - like that -

288
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,950
what if that was really hot
what do you do?

289
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,322
It's quite hot but it's nice as well.

290
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,956
Oh - yeah it's quite hot -

291
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,363
but the thing is even though
it's quite hot - it's mild hot -

292
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,435
when that's with all that
really milky mozzarella,

293
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,233
olive oil and stuff it's gonna be superb.

294
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,437
What else would you use these for?

295
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,840
These chillies?

296
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:40,580
God - you can do 'em so much - er -
you can do 'em with like boiled rice - er

297
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,744
in with noodles - and I like
'em especially in like spaghetti

298
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:47,824
or pastas and stuff like that -
over grilled vegetables - in salads -

299
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,894
loads of stuff and just a couple
you know don't put loads in -

300
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,531
just a couple to sort
of liven it up a bit.

301
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:02,102
Right - so what we do now is just really
roughly sprinkle it over the mozzarella -

302
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:06,005
don't be fussy - don't do anything
sort of restauranty with it -

303
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,612
sprinkle it all over and that's beautiful.

304
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,873
So then what we've gotta do
is get some herbs -

305
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:12,951
and we've got some nice herbs.

306
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,849
I've got some purple basil and some green
basil and I'm just gonna rip it up -

307
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,388
really kind of roughly -just over it -

308
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,292
Purple basil is rather unusual isn't it?

309
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,953
I suppose it is unusual - but -
you can get it in all the supermarkets now

310
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,156
and you know looks great
and it tastes really good.

311
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,823
Does it taste different from green basil?

312
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,299
Slightly different yeah -
slightly fresher -

313
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,371
slightly more kind of aniseedy I think.

314
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,270
The thing I like about is even
an idiot like me can do it -

315
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,136
you just chuck it -

316
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,005
you know all this
no positioning or anything -

317
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,010
just chuck it all over the place.

318
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,248
Black pepper very important.

319
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,447
Just do it from a height
so it kind of scatters -

320
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,588
some nice sea salt from a height again.

321
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,953
And er - I've got some nice -
nice olive oil.

322
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,255
You can be nice and generous -
again just scatter it.

323
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,496
Would you say that's a chef's tip then?

324
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,033
Well no - no -
I'm not doing it to be ponsy -

325
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,296
I'm just doing it because
if you do from a height then -

326
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,632
you're not gonna get a whole load
of pepper of a whole load of salt

327
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,038
or whole load of oil in one place
so it looks a bit kind of you know -

328
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,274
...no just do it.

329
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,744
And lemon juice I think -

330
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:20,407
you could go for balsamic vinegar
which would look quite pretty

331
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,815
but I think that - I don't wanna hide -
balsamic vinegar's quite sweet

332
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,150
and I don't wanna hide up
the sweetness of the chillies.

333
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:31,552
Yeah - lovely -

334
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,028
that's gonna be really nice
and that looks fantastic.

335
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:38,425
< PEAS, SPINACH AND FETA CHEESE >

336
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:43,101
This was a bit of a fluke really
how this salad came about really

337
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,800
cos I was just walking down the er -
supermarket -

338
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,379
getting my fruit and veg as per norm
and I was tucking into the -

339
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:54,508
the peas and er - they were so fresh
and sweet and it was lovely -

340
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,655
and I thought -
oh why can't raw peas work in a salad?

341
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:02,692
So all I do is just get the old peas out
and if you're lucky they'll all be small.

342
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,092
You do get the odd fat ball like a bullet
and you don't want that at all -

343
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,859
so you can either cook them
the next day in a different way -

344
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,264
or you could blanche them
and put 'em in the salad,

345
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,428
but I personally think you know
you loose the whole idea about it.

346
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:19,041
So - I've got some washed baby spinach.

347
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:23,807
All I'm gonna do is chop
the old spinach in a bowl -

348
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:28,319
chuck the little peas in as well -
I'm gonna really simple dress it.

349
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:33,315
I need some olive oil -
a good kind of four, five second lug -

350
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,392
you know about 4/5 tablespoons -

351
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,424
just enough to coat your spinach really

352
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,497
and then you wanna about
the same again in lemon juice

353
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,760
and the lemon is quite
important do you know

354
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:46,131
what I mean cos it's quite a summery
thing and lovely fresh crunch peas

355
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,298
and the lemon kind of pulls it
all together so it's quite important.

356
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,102
Just do it to taste really.

357
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,274
And then I wanna good pinch of salt

358
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,245
and a little bit of pepper

359
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,047
and just sort of give it a dress.

360
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,614
Do you always do that with your hands?

361
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,821
Well you can use tongs
if you like but it just -

362
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,123
I like to get stuck in
you know what I mean?

363
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:14,724
Makes it more fun.

364
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,066
So let's taste one.

365
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,233
Mmmm - yeah that's fine.

366
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:24,933
So once you've done that -
just chuck the old spinach on -

367
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,168
on the plate -

368
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,179
and you'll always get left with a really
lovely pile of like peas at the bottom

369
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,513
so once the spinach is all there -
just kind of sprinkle all the peas around.

370
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,412
I love all that - it just -
just reminds me of summertime so much.

371
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,318
And then - got some feta cheese.

372
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,360
You can buy - I bought this
in a block over the counter -

373
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,329
you can buy in a pack or
you know whatever you can get hold of.

374
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,992
You know funky little block like that -
and I just love it to bits.

375
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,161
And just crumble it any old how.

376
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,197
Would you use any other sort of cheese?

377
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,539
No to be honest with you in this salad
it's so simple and it works so well -

378
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,976
feta cheese is the only one
for the job because it's kind of -

379
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,878
it's kind of creamy -
it's nice and salty -

380
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,042
and it's kind of a bit tangy
as well you know

381
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,314
and I just think I can't think of
a cheese that would do it to be honest.

382
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,285
Er - and the coulour's just look great

383
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,858
and just sort of maybe bob it
about a bit so it gets in there.

384
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,586
And that's just about it.

385
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,698
The easiest salad in the world.

386
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,729
And it tastes pucker.

387
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,196
Lovely - I like that.

388
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:50,951
< JUNGLE BOOGIE COCKTAIL >

389
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,694
I got that sugar syrup done mate.

390
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:55,798
Excellent.

391
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:56,956
What's that Damian?

392
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:00,730
This is - this is just a sugar -
sugar syrup with a -

393
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,201
with a bit of orange and mint.

394
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,901
How much sugar and water did you put in?

395
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:10,343
Well I did a quarter of a pound
of sugar and a pint of water

396
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,005
and I just reduced it to a third.

397
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,276
That's the base of er ...?

398
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,683
That's what the basic is -
it gives a really fresh sort of taste.

399
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,384
Cos we don't need all these peels
and mint and there.

400
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,353
What is this cocktail thing -
what's it called?

401
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,621
This cocktail's called Jungle Boogie -
I made it for Jamie -

402
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,424
I really appreciate that.

403
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,361
So what you have to do bro

404
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,994
is chop the pineapple and er

405
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,502
orange and mango into hunks.

406
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:35,401
Into hunks?

407
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,302
Into hunks.

408
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,442
Hunks and chunks.

409
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,940
We use a white and dark rum...

410
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,308
the dark colour's a bit sweeter than er -
than the white one.

411
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,716
And it sort of balances each other out.

412
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,687
So I'm gonna add that to the syrup -
smelling pretty intense.

413
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,353
I forgot the umbrellas.

414
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,115
Oh no.

415
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,559
I wanted to have a true
Del Boy style cocktail.

416
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:00,987
Now we have to do is er - add the juices -
we've got some orange juice -

417
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,531
we've got some pineapple juice
and we've got some mango juice.

418
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,996
So have you know Damian a long time Jamie.

419
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:12,041
Well yeah - I work with Damian
and he's a choice barman - and er -

420
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,441
we kind of work together really -
or we did work together for three years.

421
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,979
Just - shall I put this straight in there?

422
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,706
Yeah just chuck it in.

423
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,575
Mate I'm sorry cos I'm getting
a bit nervous now - I've got butterflies.

424
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,015
How many people coming over?

425
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,588
About 40 but if it goes pear shaped

426
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,157
it's just me and you mate
and that big bottle of rum.

427
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,924
So we're gonna put a little bit
of lime juice in there -

428
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,289
gives it a bit more flavour.

429
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,626
Liven it up a bit.

430
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,660
The last finishing touch for it is to put
a bit of grated fresh nutmeg on it.

431
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,737
How much do you have to put in?

432
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,670
You just - you just grate to taste.

433
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,740
Bit like salt and pepper.

434
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,242
Yeah exactly try it Jamie.

435
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,275
I'm looking forward to this.

436
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:52,973
What do you think?

437
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:57,087
Yeah! - That's gonna do the trick.

438
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,649
You look sharp - I look a tramp -

439
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:03,487
so I'm gonna get dressed and
you look after yourself for 10 minutes.

440
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:03,960
Sure.
