1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:03,362
Naked's what I call my way of cooking.

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:05,333
What I cook in the restaurant isn't
what I cook at home.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,970
Cooking's gotta be a laugh.

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:08,766
It's gotta be simple

5
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,342
- it's gotta be tasty
- it's gotta be fun.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,045
I suppose you could say it's stripping
down the recipe to its bare essentials.

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,052
No way - it's not me it's the food.

8
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,218
You're early - what's this -

9
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,355
the element of surprise -
come in have a cup of tea.

10
00:00:58,324 --> 00:00:59,518
What are you up to today Jamie?

11
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,626
Well I've got my uncle Alan coming round -

12
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:05,088
and he's bringing all my cousins with him,
and he's popping off to the boat show,

13
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,530
so I'm sort of left baby-sitting
so I've gotta keep them amused - er -

14
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,528
but they're gonna come back later and
I'm gonna cook them some dinner

15
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,299
so I wanna make a -
we're gonna have a bit of a pasta feast -

16
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,500
and I'm gonna make
two different types of ravioli

17
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,611
and a thing called semi freddo

18
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,872
which is pretty much like ice cream
but a bit more funky.

19
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:25,950
So I'm gonna go and see my mate Patricia
who's got a really nice cheese shop

20
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,480
cos the pasta's got
quite a bit of cheese in it

21
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,120
and she always really looks after me,

22
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,622
so I'd better get cracking really -
I've gotta get dressed -

23
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:36,250
I'm gonna knock up a bit of lunch before
I go out and er - get on with the day.

24
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,859
< SPAGHETTI >

25
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,801
Right I'm gonna make this really
fantastic spaghetti dish -

26
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,031
it's like a real good munchie kind
of lunchie snackie kind of thing.

27
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,175
Let me show you how to do it.

28
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,240
I'm gonna make the pangrattato -

29
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,105
and we're gonna sprinkle it
on top of the pasta afterwards

30
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,803
and it's gonna give it a really,
really pucker texture.

31
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,106
What it is is crispy bread crumbs -

32
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,452
you can use fresh bread
if you want but I personally -

33
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,314
it's not as good really cos
you have to fight for longer then -

34
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,752
but er - dried stuff is idea.

35
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,389
So just cut most of the crust off -
don't be too worried about it.

36
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,819
You can rip it up - chop it up -

37
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,259
do what you like but I'm just gonna
whiz it - whiz it in here.

38
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:12,989
Just pulse this right -

39
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:20,196
And get some olive oil and get it
like a four or five second lug -

40
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,900
about four tablespoons.

41
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,475
Oil's getting hot -
couple of cloves of garlic -

44
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,916
So anyway - we need some thyme now.

45
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,381
You can get it everywhere.

46
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,346
Just pick it at the end here -
right and just whoop down like that -

47
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,513
and it's really tasty -

48
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,591
you know it's a really kind
of earthy kind of herb.

49
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,727
Doesn't matter what you do with thyme -

50
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,658
if you put it into oil
it always spits so be careful,

51
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,990
but it's not the end of the world.

52
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:51,303
Right - now these are in -
put your bread crumbs in -

53
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,867
stir them about a bit and this is -
this is really quick -

54
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,533
this takes about a minute
to get really crispy.

55
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,679
You can see all that's
getting nice and golden now.

56
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,913
I'd say this is just about perfect.

57
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,748
The littler bits are dead crispy and the
bigger bits are quite chewy and that's -

58
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,288
you know that's a nice thing.

59
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,223
That gives character.

60
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,519
So that's - that's hot.

61
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,922
Leave that to cool down.

62
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,661
Right - so what I need to do now -

63
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,230
I'm gonna cook the pasta
and make the sauce.

64
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,760
Water's boiling.

65
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,466
Right for this sauce
I'm gonna show you how simple it is.

66
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:30,803
All it is is anchovies - I've got -
I've got some dried chillies here -

67
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,908
a lemon and what else do we need?
- I need garlic.

68
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,277
Couple of tablespoons of olive oil.

69
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,911
Put your garlic in.

70
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,847
And just fire off the garlic -

71
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,684
not until brown or anything -
but just so it softens up.

72
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,222
These particular chillies are just
fresh ones that I've dried at home

73
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,763
and they're not that -
they're not really that strong.

74
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,200
About five anchovies.

75
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,838
Jiggle it around a bit.

76
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:10,039
Then all you do is just get a nice lemon -
I've taken most of the pips out.

77
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:17,385
Funnily enough it's the lemon that
makes it work cos I never kind anchovies

78
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,583
but you don't - when they melt away
they don't really taste like that.

79
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,995
You get the lovely heat from the chillie -

80
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,892
right just check this pasta again -
yeah looks pretty well.

81
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,260
Mmm - perfect.

82
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,836
Right - I'm gonna drain this -

83
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,106
and then when it's still steaming hot
put it into that sauce.

84
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,114
And you just swill it about
and take it off the heat now -

85
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,477
I'll turn the gas off.

86
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,247
And like that's all coated
in like all the sauce -

87
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,083
it's shiny and it's just really tasty.

88
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,383
So just whack it in a bowl.

89
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,083
No mucking about -
scrap out all the juice.

90
00:04:56,262 --> 00:05:02,098
Get all these crispy bits and
just er - look at that - oooh...

91
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,770
You know that tastes nice don't you?

92
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,246
What are you laughing at?

93
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,711
That's how you're supposed to eat it.

94
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,986
Actually I like these so much
I'm gonna have some more.

95
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,190
And in cooking it won't be lost.

96
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,903
Very soft isn't it?

97
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,670
Unfortunately - very very fresh.

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,978
I like fat men.

99
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:28,846
You like men with a bit of meat on?

100
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:29,919
Absolutely.

101
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,751
Well give me six more months -
I might be there.

102
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:39,021
< FRESH PASTA >

103
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,423
This is strong white flour.

104
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,430
And so I do 500 grams.

105
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,835
Like everything there's different
recipes but this is one that is very,

106
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:51,033
very reliable and damn good.

107
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,644
So what I'm gonna do - 500 grams -

108
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:58,175
you can make -
you can make this by hand in a bowl.

109
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,409
It's just as easy.

110
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,213
I'm gonna do it in this cos it
just takes a little bit of work away.

111
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:07,155
I put two whole eggs in and
then I'm gonna put 8 egg yolks

112
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:11,987
and the reason that I'm putting
8 yolks in as opposed to 4 eggs is

113
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:17,262
because the extra yolk
I feel give it a certain richness

114
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,234
which is just really beautiful.

115
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:24,035
It's really silky, gives a wicked colour
and I just think you know it makes it

116
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,235
what fresh pasta is really -
that richness.

117
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:36,518
Right -
so basically just gonna turn it out.

118
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,559
Doesn't look much like pasta now.

119
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,353
Looks like broken up... biscuits?

120
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,329
Yeah but then you squeeze it
and then you start to work it.

121
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:52,035
And now you just put all your weight
into it and just keep doing this

122
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:56,471
and it'll come together
as a quite dry dough.

123
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:01,306
Keep giving it some
until it goes smooth and silky.

124
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,373
So that's done really.

125
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:04,743
So just warp it up -

126
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:10,579
push it out and put it in the fridge
for about half an hour.

127
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,855
Let it rest and then we can carry on.

128
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,489
Right so the pasta's had about
half an hour to rest.

129
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,229
Er - it's softened up a little bit,
it's - it's a little bit -

130
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,164
you know it's gonna be a lot
more pliable now cos it's relaxed.

131
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,139
Make sure you've got a nice clean surface.

132
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,832
I mean you only need about that much space
but I'm lucky I've got a bit longer

133
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,843
and you need one of these machines
and they're about 20 quid

134
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,913
and you can get them
absolutely everywhere.

135
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:36,878
It's like a mangle.

136
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,812
But they've got little notches here yeah -

137
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,545
that go up and down and
that gets thinner and fatter.

138
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,616
So look - look at that lovely dough.

139
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:50,328
Right we're gonna divide this by four
and basically put three back

140
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,896
because we don't want these to get dry
and it's nice and soft

141
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,499
and if the air gets to that
it'll from a skin

142
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,465
and that'll be horrible to roll out then.

143
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,839
So just roll -
wrap those up and with this one -

144
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,567
you just wanna with your hand
or rolling pin

145
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,576
if you want just kind of
level it out a little bit.

146
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,411
And then it's gonna be really easy

147
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,243
to sort of put through the machine
without too much grief.

148
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,309
Put it on its thickest setting

149
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,011
and we just run it through
quite slowly on the first time.

150
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,818
See

151
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,323
- So now we'll start
working down one by one.

152
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,366
Some people find it easier if you dust it.

153
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,130
I'm not a great lover
of dusting it too much

154
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,365
but if you just do
a little bit and then right...

155
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,565
What does that do for it then?

156
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,472
Well it - some people put loads on
but I just put it on

157
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,113
and wipe off the excess and
it just stops it from sticking to this

158
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,407
and then when it comes out of this end

159
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,451
and it gathers up stops it
from sticking at that end as well.

160
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,621
Right so if I leave it now -

161
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,520
it's getting a bit thinner and
it's kind of building up here.

162
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,526
So you wanna kind of pull it
in a bit there and flatten it out -

163
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:57,993
give it a little bit of tension.

164
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,661
And you can get a little bit there -

165
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,462
see it's pulling in a bit there -
so just pull it in this bit.

166
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,770
And there you go - lovely.

167
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,600
This is done basically now.

168
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,973
Normally I just -
I'd make the ravioli straight away now

169
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,415
but you know if time's not on your side
then make it now in the morning,

170
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,750
and er - you know I can do my fillings
a little bit later and if you er -

171
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,888
layer this up quite tightly
like this on a plate -

172
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,223
a little bit of flour - and er -

173
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,658
cling film it tightly
so the air doesn't get to it -

174
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,600
it'll probably keep in the fridge
for a couple of hours - really well.

175
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,834
I always make this amount -
even if I'm just making it for myself

176
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,240
because even if you're only using
a little bit you can make some more pasta

177
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,879
and I've got it like dried up
there you know -

178
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,106
just taglitelli -
papadelli whatever you want.

179
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:56,644
< PRALINE SEMI FREIDO >

180
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,055
I'm gonna make the dessert now.

181
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,316
It's a thing called semi freddo

182
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,053
which at home is definitely
the nearest best thing to ice cream.

183
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,490
It's very flexible you can do
any flavour you like.

184
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,265
And I'm gonna do praline

185
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,435
which is basically caramel

186
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,800
and roasted hazelnuts
which to me is just like the best combo.

187
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,501
So what I need is 200 grams
of castor sugar -

188
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,236
it's not a hot pan but it's heating up now

189
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:24,042
and I need about
3 or 4 tablespoons of water.

190
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,711
And what this is gonna do
is loosen up the sugar,

191
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,012
make it a syrup

192
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,787
and let me show you the hazelnuts.

193
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,124
I've just roasted them
until lightly golden.

194
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:41,566
If you look at this sugar it's starting
to colour round the outside very slowly.

195
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,702
And then you just splish it about a bit,
so it's even.

196
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,901
Don't be too aggressive -just gently.

197
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,204
So what's Uncle Alan like
who's coming round today?

198
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,174
Uncle Alan?

199
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,905
Everyone says that
he used to look like Cliff Richard.

200
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,951
Cliff Richard! - But er -

201
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,918
I don't think he looks that
much like Cliff Richard but -

202
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,347
well he certainly can't sing anyway.

203
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,421
No there's no way
Alan could be like Cliff Richard

204
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:13,429
cos Cliff Richard never got married
and Uncle Alan's had three wives.

205
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:19,434
This caramel now is light golden -
carefully pour them in.

206
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,102
And what we're gonna do now
is just cook it for about another minute.

207
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,604
Slush it about a bit.

208
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,017
Cook it for another minute and
then look at how gorgeous that looks -

209
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,516
it's shiny and golden
and what we're gonna -

210
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,917
we're just toasting the nuts now

211
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,820
and they're both kind of impregnating
the flavour into each other really -

212
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,459
the caramel's getting hazelnut and
the hazelnut's getting caramel.

213
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,121
So I'm gonna put it on a metal tray

214
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,428
but I mean er you can put it
on a plate or anything

215
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,093
that's not gonna melt really.

216
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,933
And just put a bit of sunflower oil on -
just a little drib -

217
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,735
rub it in and
this'll stop it from sticking.

218
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,800
And that's ready.

219
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:05,076
Superb - so just pour it in the middle -
try and get all the sugar out -

220
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,186
be careful not to drip any on yourself
cos that would be very hot.

221
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,014
And then just with the bottom
of your spoon just push it out.

222
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,186
So they're all flat and then
they'll cool down nice and quick.

223
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,530
Right so this praline's been
cooling down now for about 25 minutes

224
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,396
and as you can see
it's like a big biscuit -

225
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,663
it's like - it's all completely solid.

226
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,333
But the really - listen listen -

227
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,275
and that's the nice thing
about the metal actually

228
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,174
it's a little bit flexible
which means you can kind of...

229
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,243
just whack it in here
and then like pulse it.

230
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:45,891
Perfect.

231
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,724
You've got powder and you got bits
of chunk in there which is ideal -

232
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,327
loads of flavour - loads of texture.

233
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,828
So I can forget about this now -
that's the nice things -

234
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,660
flavour done - right -
and let me just make the semi freddo.

235
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,503
We need four eggs yolks -
I need 50 grams of sugar -

236
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,236
okay - shove it in there.

237
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,103
Straight in there and just whish
these together until they both pale.

238
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,636
Right now it's a bit paler -

239
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,917
I'm gonna add some vanilla and
a good one should be sort of soft -

240
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,054
not dry - soft and slightly sticky
if you're really lucky

241
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:20,589
and you just cut it near enough the tip -
all the way down the middle right -

242
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,628
and then inside
you've got all the beans here -

243
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:27,425
you just get the point of your knife
and just run it right to the end

244
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,261
and you get all of that
and it's dead pucker.

245
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,232
Just scrap it on the old whish.

246
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,839
To me vanilla pods is probably
one of the most amazing ingredients -

247
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,342
in the kitchen I just think it's stunning.

248
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,871
You wouldn't use vanilla essence
would you for this?

249
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,343
No, - it just smell so different.

250
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,573
Anyway don't chuck away
these cos obviously 70p each

251
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,910
they're worth quite a bit -

252
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:50,249
pop it in a little pot of sugar and
that'll infuse its flavour into the sugar

253
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,049
then you've got vanilla flavoured sugar.

254
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,517
Just look at that.

255
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,024
All those black dots -
I mean how funky is that?

256
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,492
It is isn't it?

257
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,725
But again just whisk like mad

258
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,801
and it'll get slightly thicker
and a little bit more paler.

259
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:13,577
Beautiful right - double cream -
500 millilitres.

260
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,281
When this cream gets like nice and thick -

261
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:25,083
sort of ribbon stage - like that see?
- Not thin anymore is it?

262
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,550
We're ready to rock and
roll with the egg whites.

263
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,362
Okay - the thing is with the egg whites -

264
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:40,636
just a little pinch of salt -
just before you start whipping and

265
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,168
You can't taste that though can you?

266
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,808
No you can't taste it
but what it does is it -

267
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,444
it does something to the eggs and
it makes it capture the air more

268
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,876
and be stiffer which is exactly
what we want so -

269
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,947
So look you can see it getting
bigger and bigger already.

270
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,450
Not quite.

271
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,727
Nearly.

272
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,525
See - wicked.

273
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,795
Right we've got loads of air in the egg -

274
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,634
got loads of air in the cream and
we've made a lovely flavour right -

275
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,938
so what we do is we just pour
most of this praline - most of -

276
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:26,073
leave a bit into the cream and just pour
all these egg whites on top of that -

277
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,552
and very gently fold it in -
you're not being aggressive with it -

278
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,918
do you know what I mean
you're just folding in the flavours

279
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,424
just to kind of gently mix it together.

280
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:39,155
If you bang it together with a whish
or even with a spoon all that air

281
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,889
that you've just been trying
to put into the egg whites

282
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,261
and the cream just disappears
and you can hear it bubble

283
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:47,030
and you don't want that so just fold it
in and when you're just about there -

284
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,696
and have a little scoop round
the middle to make sure you haven't -

285
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:53,038
there see that there -
got a bit there -just scoop it in.

286
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,270
Now I'm quite happy with that now -

287
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,845
there's some chunks of stuff
there but I like -

288
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,346
I like it quite marbled.

289
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,814
You could use that praline
for all sorts of other things.

290
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:00,610
I'm sure couldn't you?

291
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,344
Oh God - you use pralines for everything -

292
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,285
and all you have to do is get
some really nice vanilla ice cream -

293
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,181
nice big ball of that
and sprinkle it on top

294
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,556
and it tastes wicked I tell you what
I have done sometimes actually - er -

295
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,289
got a couple of packets of Maltesers
and this sounds really,

296
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,992
really drab but you just whiz 'em up
so they're like chunky powder

297
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,034
and put them on top -
and they're really nice -

298
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,762
I tell you really, really tasty.

299
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,067
Scrap it all from the sides -

300
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,711
yeah -just shake it
so it levels out a little bit

301
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,281
then with this left over praline
just sprinkle it on top.

302
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,352
I know the kids are gonna love that -
right up their alley.

303
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,613
Just chuck it in the freezer -

304
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,451
bout - I suppose it will be ready
in about 40 minutes.

305
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:52,369
Hello mate you alright?

306
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,505
Nice to see you -

307
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,333
looks like you've got
the short straw today eh?

308
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:01,077
Have a nice time at the boat show and
you gonna come by for some food later?

309
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,379
Take care - see you mate.

310
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:07,137
< RAVIOLI FILLING >

311
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,041
How's it going girls alright?

312
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:20,685
Right I am making the fillings for
the ravioh and I'm making two fillings.

313
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,885
First one is potato, water cress
and cheeses from Patricia

314
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,155
which will be lovely jubbly
and the potatoes are ready

315
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:31,735
so I'm just gonna drain these and
I've also put in four cloves of garlic

316
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,198
which I've taken the outside off.

317
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,466
I'll show you one.

318
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:40,838
And when they're cooked with the potatoes
- see how soft they are see - wicked. So.

319
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,412
Do you leave those in then?

320
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,706
Yeah leave them in cos they've got
no skins or anything like that

321
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:49,343
but when garlic cooks like that
it gets very, very mild and er -

322
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,283
I think it just adds a good edge
to the potatoes really -

323
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,391
so let them drain for about
three or four minutes -

324
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,824
let all the moisture sort
of evaporate off and -

325
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:02,532
so I've got some really nice gorgonzola
and some pecarino from Patricia.

326
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:11,635
Lovely - that's gorgonzola - it's really,
really nice - nice and crumbly.

327
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,402
Really tasty - quite a strong flavour

328
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,241
but when it's in with those potatoes

329
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,449
it's going to chill out a bit -
be really nice.

330
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:22,109
And I've got this pecarino which is
I suppose you could say you shouldn't say

331
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,755
but you could say
it's quite similar to parmesan.

332
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:30,725
It's slightly softer, nice and sweet -
not sweet sweet but sweeter.

333
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:32,959
Just chuck in there -

334
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,156
the garlic will go to you know to a paste

335
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,426
and mix in really well.

336
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,661
While this is hot I'm gonna get
all these flavours in there

337
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,328
so they're all kind of melting
and all the flavours are happening.

338
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,303
So I'm gonna use about
half of this to start with -

339
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,874
just gonna break it in there.

340
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,012
And this pecarino just take skin off -

341
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,309
That pecarino does look
a bit like parmesan.

342
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,509
Yeah but it's - it's softer -

343
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,177
it's hasn't been aged as long -
I really like it actually.

344
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,923
What I need to get now is some butter.

345
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,559
I'm just gonna use about an ounce
just to enrich it a little bit.

346
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,495
I've got some really nice watercress - er

347
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:10,624
What makes it really nice then?

348
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,064
Well just look at it - it's really green -

349
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,638
big fat leaves and it's really
mustardy and I love all that -

350
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:19,072
it's really pucker I've dumped it
in water like I do with basil -

351
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,539
shaken it about a bit
so it's nice and clean.

352
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,216
So let's put that in there -

353
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,744
this is gonna start
tasting really good now.

354
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,588
At this stage I mean it looks like
mashed potato doesn't it?

355
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,953
You imagine that with maybe
some more butter in it you know - er

356
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:39,663
with a nice bit of roasted cod
or like you know fish and... lovely.

357
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,770
I'm really happy with that -

358
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,235
so that's one filling done
I've got to check on the next filling -

359
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,602
so I'll go and see what the girls
are doing with the broad beans.

360
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,248
Superb.

361
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,079
Alright -
so I've got my lovely broad beans.

362
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,716
First things first - get the broad beans -
gonna go straight into boiling water.

363
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,487
And then absolutely no salt in there

364
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,064
because salt actually makes the outsides
of the broad bean get tougher

365
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,463
so we can just season it later - not now.

366
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,662
Now whereas the base for
the other ravioli was potato

367
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,602
and that was lovely jubbly
and it's finished,

368
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:25,641
this one is gonna be ricotta -
it's a very,

369
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:34,810
very crumbly kind of light cheese
and you know it's very very young.

370
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,216
It's not got loads and loads of flavour
but it's kind of fresh -

371
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,254
it's got like a real milky taste
and I like that.

372
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:40,516
So make sure it's really,

373
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,025
really fresh cos it does go off quite
quickly compared to other cheeses.

374
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,862
So I'm just gonna
put this ricotta in a bowl -

375
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,628
these have been in for about a minute

376
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,767
so

377
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,003
- gonna pour those in there.

378
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,269
Drain it off a bit.

379
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:59,069
I'm gonna try and finely chop some
and then leave the other quite coarse

380
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,736
and what happens then is that
you're kind of getting lots of texture

381
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,905
and you can see
what you're eating which is nice.

382
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,313
Also you're getting loads of flavour
in there as well and you want that.

383
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,386
What I'm gonna do is pour
this into the bowl -

384
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,250
you can put as much mint in as you like
but I just do it to freshen it up -

385
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,860
so you just keep tasting.

386
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:23,765
And it's funny cos this herb actually
makes the dish a lot lighter really tasty

387
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,960
and it goes with broad beans so well

388
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,835
so I'm just gonna chuck this in
with the broad beans -

389
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,341
it's still a little bit hot -
I can put a pinch of salt in now -

390
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,244
and a little bit of pepper cos
we didn't season that in water.

391
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:41,612
And give it a good little lug of olive oil
cos that'll get all the flavours happening

392
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,551
And just toss it over a bit.

393
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,525
Bout half a lemon.

394
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,994
What we've gotta do now
is grate some parmesan.

395
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,630
You only want a little bit -
about a handful.

396
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,074
Right so nice handful of that.

397
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:10,774
Get a fork and just fork it through
and you can see how crumbly

398
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,112
and light this ricotta is -
it's a wicked base for this.

399
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,110
And this is what I do -

400
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,780
is this mixture
just pour it all into here.

401
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,558
And just fold it in.

402
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,423
Fold it in and mash it up -

403
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,963
do whatever you have to do
to get it stuck in there

404
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,465
and you can see
it's got a brilliant colour now.

405
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,497
Just taste a bit.

406
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:40,578
Mmm - that's perfect so basically
we've got two fillings done -

407
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,538
and what I've gotta do now
is show you how to make a ravioli.

408
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,515
Just brush off the excess flour right -

409
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,278
and you get a little bit of your filling

410
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:54,791
and you want about a dessertspoonful
and then get a little bit of water -

411
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,326
brush round the edges -
all four sides and once you've done that -

412
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,362
look at the corners -

413
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,261
cos it's the water that's
gonna stick it all together

414
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,129
and that's really important
so don't forget it -

415
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:08,796
just fold it over, push it together
there so this side's now sealed.

416
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,705
Come over here and push that side together
cos that sides now sealed.

417
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,243
And then put your two little fingers -

418
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,403
curl your thumb round
and just do that and just -

419
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,379
and then you've just got one bit left.

420
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:20,381
Don't just b... it

421
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,144
cos you'll get a bit of air
stuck in there - you don't want that.

422
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,346
Start from one end,
and get rid of the air.

423
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,352
And there you have it -
perfect ravioli - no cracks,

424
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,553
no nothing and
then just take with a cutter,

425
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,988
just trim it off and what that does -

426
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,530
it doesn't just cut a pretty shape in it

427
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,602
it kinds of pushes the pasta together.
So it means it's not gonna burst open.

428
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:40,696
Could you use a knife?

429
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,965
Yeah you could use a knife -
in actual fact it's -

430
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,309
it's quite cool to use a knife as well
cos this is quite an obvious thing to do,

431
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,046
so I just chuck this straight
into boiling salted water -

432
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,843
give it about two minutes for that sort
of size and then just fish 'em out -

433
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,246
shake 'em off on a plate.

434
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,018
Come on girls give us a hand then.

435
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,817
Grab a plate and grab a spoon.

436
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,485
You watching.

437
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,325
This is like Blue Peter this is.

438
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:13,432
Grab a bit of filling about that much and
then put it in the middle of one side.

439
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,934
Not too much water though -
just brush round the outside of it.

440
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,702
What happened to your one?

441
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,613
Fold it over like that.

442
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,884
And then - then squeeze all around it.

443
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,512
So yours are wicked.

444
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,854
I think I'm gonna employ you -
bit of cheap labour.

445
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,193
Had a good time.

446
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,893
You haven't destroyed the place then?
