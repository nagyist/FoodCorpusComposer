1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,463
Naked's what I call my way of cooking

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,696
what I cook in the restaurant
isn't what I cook at home.

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,196
Cooking's gotta be a laugh.

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,401
It's gotta be simple. It's gotta be
tasty. It's gotta be fun.

5
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:17,008
I suppose you could say it's striping down
the recipe to its bare essentials.

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,248
No way it's me - it's the food.

7
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,019
You do not believe how happy I am to see

8
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,916
not that I'm not happy
to see you all the time

9
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,579
but I've just been shopping
with George for an hour

10
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,691
and I think that's enough
punishment for any man.

11
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,824
The worst scenario is - is when they pick
up two things that they like

12
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,055
one that they really wanna buy
and one that they don't.

13
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:44,329
And it's kind of like er-er-right
er - well darling they're both very nice

14
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,835
and there's kind of like the
sweat starts dripping

15
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:49,635
and it's which one does she like and
I pick the wrong one - no I got it wrong.

16
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,668
She's meeting up with like six
really good friends today

17
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:56,145
and they're all gonna go clubbing
and she's allowed me to tag along

18
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,415
thanks very much.

19
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,347
So we're gonna you know have a good night out

20
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,885
and then they're gonna come back
to the flat and kip over.

21
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,784
I've gotta provide munchies and service

22
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,187
Jools says my payment is to hang
around with me and my mates,

23
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,261
so I'll just have to ham
it up to the boys.

24
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,827
What did you do last night?

25
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,498
Spent it with six lovely ladies.
Thank you.

26
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,263
< PUKKOLA >

27
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:53,331
I am gonna make the most fantastic
breakfast in the world

28
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,873
and it's called Pukkola

29
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:59,206
because it's pucker and my
name's Jamie Oliver.

30
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,644
And I've been searching for years
for like the perfect breakfast

31
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,341
yeah like a muesli type thing
let me show you how you do it.

32
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:13,584
Right - so I've basically got about
8 scoops of organic Scottish porridge oats

33
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,729
yeah - so that's the base really
that's the main thing.

34
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:20,663
And then I want about two handfuls of bran

35
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,003
and then I've got some dried fruits
right which are quite nice cos they're

36
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:30,441
yeah - I love dried apricots because
to me they're like wine gums.

37
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,137
If I ever had a kid right who just wanted
to keep eating wine gums all the time

38
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,044
and had a problem with rotting teeth
sounds nice doesn't it?

39
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,082
I'd just give him these cos
I think they're fantastic.

40
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:43,154
The second one I've got is dates
and these are dried

41
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,257
and they're sweet and they're chewy
and they're caramely

44
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,355
you know I hate anchovies, I hate dates.

45
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,690
But you won't be able to
taste it as a date

46
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,561
it'll just be like a
like a flavour really.

47
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,126
So have you been practicing your dancing?

48
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,171
Yeah! No I'll let you into a secret yeah

49
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,241
I am probably the world's worst dancer

50
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,875
I don't think I'm going to be impressing
the girls tonight too much

51
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,139
do I try and be cool and
get it completely wrong

52
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,283
or do I just walk in there
as my normal self

53
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,351
and just you know have all the
girls walking home saying

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,785
he's nice that Jamie but
he's a terrible dancer.

55
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:22,994
Oh yeah - anyway look you can
see it's all chopped up now

56
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:26,963
it's actually quite sticky - quite most
- so - put that in there...

57
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,567
So that sweetens the - the mixture?

58
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,828
Yeah we're talking about
natural sweetness here,

59
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,098
so the next thing we do
are nuts my old mate.

60
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,435
And I've got three nuts and
a handful of each yeah.

61
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,774
I've got my almonds which are great,
I've got the old Brazil nuts

62
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,972
now almonds and Brazil nuts are great
cos they're a white nut

63
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,812
and when you smash 'em up they go
almost really creamy

64
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,416
and sort of powdery which is lovely.

65
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,019
And then I've got the er
the walnuts which are quite

66
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,351
you know quite a robust sort
of nut flavour.

67
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,527
And then just - you can do it
in a Magimix if you like

68
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,162
but I just like to fold 'em up
like this and...

69
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,464
Just bash it with one of these...

70
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,633
It's good to get all your
aggression out as well.

71
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:10,708
I haven't had a drum for a while so...
or you can use the Magimix.

72
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,535
No I like it
I tell you what's good about this

73
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:16,713
and you won't get this from the Mag
is that you end up with lovely like

74
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,613
you get lovely kind of
almost bruised flour

75
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,481
and then you get lovely chunks as well,

76
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,216
and I think you know it adds to the
flavour and the er - the look really.

77
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:30,261
So all I do is mix it up now.
And turn it over.

78
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,021
Now there's no way that
I'm gonna eat all this

79
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,328
so what I can do is just whack it
in an old air tight container

80
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,733
and I have this every
morning for breakfast

81
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:43,069
and you know quite frankly
just gets your brain working.

82
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,572
Gets everything working actually.

83
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,572
This is like the Viagra of meuslis mate

84
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:53,148
Anyway what's different about this
because by all means like you know

85
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,584
just serve it in a bowl and
have it for breakfast as we all do,

86
00:05:55,755 --> 00:06:01,318
but what I'm saying is just, about an inch
over the cereal just cover it with milk

87
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,023
so there's quite a lot of milk
in there - lovely!

88
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,498
And that'll suck it all up and go lovely
and then I need like apples

89
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,569
so I've got about enough for sort of four,
five people in there.

90
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,832
So I usually do a round sort of
half an apple per person.

91
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:18,876
You do nice long grates and you can see
you get all the lovely green skin

92
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,275
they're real crunchy boys as well
just don't buy the soft ones

93
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:25,509
get the real crunchy boys that are quite
almost a little bit tart as well you know

94
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,778
But also if you think about it
like if you look when I'm grating

95
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,354
there's quite a lot of juice so you've
got that whole sort of apple

96
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:34,482
apple skin, apple juice thing
and it just makes it taste so good.

97
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,561
I tell you what else I've done
with the dried stuff yeah

98
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,757
I've made - well I was cooking flap
jacks for my cousins the other day

99
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:44,734
and I just carried on like normal flap
jacks but put the dried stuff in

100
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,065
and I used that - and it was actually
better than normal.

101
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,764
It was really, really fantastic.

102
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,674
Lovely! - So we're done mate.

103
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,105
So basically that's it - it's quite sloppy

104
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:59,116
but the thing is as I said you
can eat this like that now,

105
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,584
but if you leave this is the
fridge for like 8 hours

106
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,416
the whole thing just changes
do you know what I mean.

107
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,524
You maybe want to add a little bit
of milk when you serve it

108
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:09,150
but basically it goes sticky and Moorish
and scrumptious and like all the flavour.

109
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,991
The thing is all the - all the goodness
comes out of all the dried fruit

110
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,999
and the nuts and into the milk and then
into the - you know - it's fantastic.

111
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,497
I cling film it yeah

112
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,197
cos well not that I've got anything
that smells in the fridge,

113
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,865
but if you've got say like some
strong cheese or some onions

114
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,739
or anything like that the milk

115
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,143
and the porridge oats will take
that flavour on and you don't want that.

116
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:32,149
So - you're gonna love it
I'll let you have a bit later.

117
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:36,144
< SWEET PEA
& PRAWN RISOTTO >

118
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,886
I'm gonna make a bit of lunch
are you up for that?

119
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,828
Lovely. Got some frozen stock and I just
put a bit of hot water over it.

120
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:50,766
I'm gonna make risotto - I'm gonna make
like a sweet pea and prawn risotto

121
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:51,596
it's fantastic.

122
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:52,703
Did you make that yourself that stock?

123
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:56,399
Yeah - does that impress you?
Lovely - do you hear that

124
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,240
...er - yeah it's nice - you can use

125
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,438
cos you can use like the old
stock cubes for risotto

126
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,412
but they just taste so much
better you know

127
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,518
you can't really go wrong if
you start with a good stock.

128
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,916
So a good stock - good start already.

129
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:14,891
Second thing we need is onion,
garlic, a little bit of celery.

130
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,191
Thing about risotto - people are scared
of them - are you scared of them?

131
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,491
A bit

132
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,393
Do you have dreams about them darling?
Bit of a dodgy nightmare.

133
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,409
Listen - all this is chopped up yeah
put a bit of olive oil in there

134
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:37,545
just a little bit. And -er-right-so
basically you can hear it frying now yeah,

135
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,083
so what I'm gonna do is just
give it a little shake,

136
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,855
put a lid on top and because
you've put the lid on top

137
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,490
all the moisture that comes
out will go back down

138
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,286
and it'll kind of almost like simmer
and steam a little bit so that's good.

139
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,326
Just cook that for a couple of minutes
to get it nice and soft.

140
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,828
Get all the flavours happening
you know what I mean

141
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,331
that oil and the root veg - this should
be getting nice and soft now.

142
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,002
Let's have a little feel - yeah.

143
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,233
And it's just kind of a good
start flavour wise

144
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,605
so the next thing is the old risotto
rice and risotto rice is like

145
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,441
it's quite a short plump rice with
loads and loads of starch.

146
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:16,021
So 50 grams per person - in my case
half a handful cos I've got big hands

147
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:19,920
in your case a big handful.
And then just stir it around really.

148
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:24,052
Now I tell you what I would do now is er
put a little pinch of salt in

149
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,688
yeah because you want the seasoning to
get inside of that rice as well.

150
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,563
It's only a little details,
but it does count.

151
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,599
The first thing the rice is getting is
just sucking up all that flavoured oil,

152
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,001
all the lovely vegetables and stuff.

153
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:39,441
And when it's - it stops you know
almost like a simmering steaming sound

154
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,809
you can almost - when it starts
to sound like it's frying

155
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,618
I wanna put a little bit of
white wine in there.

156
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,157
About a glass - and you look in there now

157
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,521
all of a sudden there's this creamy stuff
has come out the rice you know

158
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,389
you wanna kind of encourage that out.

159
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:01,296
So by moving it you can see it like
just becoming sticky and lovely.

160
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:06,966
So you wanna cook this for about one
or two minutes and just smell it

161
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,836
and when you can't smell that kind of
that harsh kind of alcohol thing you know

162
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,376
you know what I mean by that, when you put
the old brandy on the Christmas pudding

163
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:18,984
when it - it stops smelling like
alcoholic, which is now basically.

164
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,176
You can start adding the stock

165
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,253
and you'll just be left with
all that lovely fragrance

166
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,390
so just tip a bit of that in there.

167
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:29,325
So you want -for the perfect risotto you
add a little bit of stock at a time.

168
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,088
And never anymore than that really.

169
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:36,031
And then as it cooks - it'll cook into
it and you know it's kind of

170
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:40,104
by stirring it - all the kind of risotto
rice is kind of moving about

171
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,173
and hitting each other. And...

172
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,900
And is the heat quite high
when you're doing that

173
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,409
It's kind of - the heat's medium high
if you have it too high

174
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,672
the outside will be cooked and
the middle will be like raw.

175
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,749
If it's too low it'll just go
like pulp so you wanna

176
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,585
medium kind heat you know
so it's constant.

177
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,550
Think risottos are fantastic
they take 20 minutes to make right

178
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,659
yeah you've gotta put a bit of love
and affection in there

179
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,988
you've gotta stir it a little bit
but big deal you know.

180
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,562
And once you've learnt this like say
you just make a couple of risottos

181
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,826
over a couple of weeks and you've cracked
it yeah - you've cracked the risotto

182
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,096
the basic risotto - next time you go
shopping and you're a bit stuck

183
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,969
well I can cook risotto so what's good
having a little walk around

184
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,699
spinach - baby spinach - fantastic

185
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,572
throw that in at the end with
a little bit of lemon juice

186
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,611
beautiful - nice Parmesan over the top.

187
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,045
Asparagus - you know you can
put any sea food

188
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,685
open up like clams or you can just
put 'em straight in.

189
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,413
How brilliant is that.
I tell you what I'm so hot

190
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,251
I've got this dripping sheep on top of me.

191
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:37,553
Oh dear oh dear - so let's have a little
taste of this now cos it's looking lovely.

192
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,698
How can you tell when it's nearly ready?

193
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,529
Well I just got a rice grain
and you eat it.!

194
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,597
And basically you want it to be soft and
a pleasure to eat and if it's not

195
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,574
if it's chalky or - or you feel
like you need a glass of water

196
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,940
after you've eaten it then no
you cook it for longer.

197
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:59,778
So it needs about 2 more minutes cooking
which is perfect cos I've got

198
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,783
well I'm cheating but...

199
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,790
- who's gonna tell me off - I am at home.

200
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,892
Got some lovely - right they're defrosted.

201
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,962
Got some lovely frozen prawns which are
really actually juicy and nice

202
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,495
and tender yeah and they look lovely

203
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,031
beautiful colour and they're
already cooked anyway

204
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,635
so they only just need to be like just
cooked with the rest of the rice

205
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,272
for two minutes and then
I've got this petite pois

206
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,736
and don't tell me who hasn't got
these in their freezer

207
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,675
cos just about everyone has
unless they're food snobs in my eyes

208
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,838
because frozen peas have got
to be the most

209
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,610
well they're the best frozen thing
in the world aren't they.

210
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,810
And I guess you could use
fresh prawns and...

211
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:38,446
Yeah yeah fresh prawns of course
and I like I feel like I'm compromising

212
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,456
but at the end of the day
I'm only feeding me and you

213
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,822
and it's you know it's not as if
I've got the Michelin star guide

214
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,429
coming round to give me a telling off.

215
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,658
So no - it's you know
it's what's in my freezer and it's real.

216
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:55,405
I'm gonna add a little bit more stock
and I think we're practically there

217
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,133
and now I'm gonna turn the heat off.

218
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,944
This is the most important thing
that I found in risotto yeah

219
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,447
so we turned the gas off right
no more heat.

220
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,609
And I wanna nice knob of butter, yeah
so let's get that in there.

221
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,517
And that's just gonna kind of
bring it all together

222
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,784
and be absolutely tasty as put
a knob of butter in there

223
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,724
and just kind of knock it up a bit
and just stir it in.

224
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,991
And we put a lid on and just leave it
forget it for 2 minutes.

225
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:26,104
If you just serve it now the rice will
go on the plate and the stock will go

226
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,638
and you'll have a plate of...
and then you'll have a pile of rice.

227
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,335
But what you want is a nice ouzy
so it's nice to eat.

228
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,636
What I want yeah just as a last thing

229
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,210
I love all that - it's so fresh.

230
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,843
I've got mint from the garden yeah
and mint's great - you just plant it

231
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:43,784
it grows like the clappers.

232
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,424
You just cut the old boys right down
and they grow back up again.

233
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,617
They've got no feelings at all
they just keep growing. But

234
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:54,495
If you look at this now it is just so
creamy and lovely, it's just ouzy you know

235
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,101
it's not gonna - it's gonna be nice
and juicy - let's have a look.

236
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,873
Mmm -just a touch of salt and pepper
right - we do want it to be perfect.

237
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:07,172
No point in going to all this trouble
and then you know it's a bit bland so...

238
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,045
I tell you what's amazing
the amount of sweetness

239
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,910
that comes out of those peas and prawns
it's lovely.

240
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:16,288
So put that in the middle of the plate
I've done a bit too much as always

241
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,254
and then get your mint and from a height
just kind of sprinkle it

242
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,292
and it's lovely to get - almost like
you've got the lovely flavour there,

243
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,293
but you have a bit of freshness on top.

244
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:28,295
And now just squeeze
this over the top yeah.

245
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,470
So there we go
right what else do we need?

246
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,505
Here - I've got some
a really good peppery olive oil yeah

247
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,734
just a little drizzle
and that's just you know

248
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,707
it's almost like a bit of pepper on top.

249
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:47,881
Taste that oh gorgeous one
go on - do you like?

250
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:48,453
It's delicious

251
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,770
< CHOCOLATE POT >

252
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:27,445
I'm gonna make er - a chocolate desert
like we call it a chocolate pot yeah

253
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,520
it's probably about the most simple
chocolate thing in the world.

254
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,249
But the good thing about it right
is cos the girls want chocolate

255
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,689
and I'm not arguing with them
at this time of night.

256
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,528
I've got half a pint of
single cream yeah

257
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,895
that I just pour in the old
in the old pan.

258
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,328
I don't wanna bring it to the boil but
I wanna bring it to a little simmer,

259
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,903
so I'm gonna whack the old gas up
and get it heating.

260
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:54,878
And most importantly - got chocolate
70% cocoa mass for cooking.

261
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,810
But if I put a whole chunk of chocolate in
it's take half an hour to melt so by...

262
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:07,690
by smashing it up does a good job so
there we go right I need some eggs.

263
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:14,091
I've got some lovely free range organic
eggs -just stand them up for a laugh.

264
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,832
Basically what I wanna do is er

265
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,303
just crack the eggs so I've got
the egg yolks yeah

266
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,806
I'm not using the egg whites
so I'm gonna chuck those away,

267
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,537
but basically the egg yolks I'll put in
this dish - it just makes it really,

268
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,012
really rich and like intensifies
the chocolate flavour.

269
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:35,181
So this cream has been on the heat for
about a minute - a minute and a half

270
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,255
so it's dead quick really and that's the
only bit of cooking that we've got to do.

271
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,892
So it's not boiling but
it's pretty much like a

272
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,851
well it's kind of like a simmer really.

273
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,462
So pop your old chocolate in

274
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,663
right - let's get a spatula right

275
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,735
and just stir this in and I love this bit

276
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:57,308
because you see cream turn into
like this pretty unbelievable thing.

277
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,410
The liquid's hot enough to
melt the chocolate?

278
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,342
Yeah just hot enough to melt the chocolate
and also these egg yolks

279
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:06,007
I'm gonna put in now as well and obviously
eggs hardly need any cooking really,

280
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,176
but you've gotta stir it while
you're doing it

281
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:11,187
cos you don't want scrambled eggs
in your old chocolate.

282
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:15,327
The nice thing is that you can see it
becoming like really, really smooth.

283
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,755
So now we've done that what do we need?
- A bit of brandy mate.

284
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,101
Don't tell them about it cos...
I think they've had their fair share

285
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:27,330
for this much I put about a tablespoon
a tablespoon and a half yeah

286
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,531
but the trick is
cos all brandy's are different

287
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,542
and I wouldn't use a cheap old horrible
brandy, do something half decent.

288
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:37,706
But have a little - stir it in and have
a little taste yeah because like brandy

289
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,443
and chocolate is quite a nice combination.

290
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,984
But if you have loads of booze
and you swallow

291
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,089
and it's like oh... horrible so.

292
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,589
So the brandy really is just for flavour?

293
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:55,934
Mmm- yeah - little bit more. The other
thing you can is like grate like orange in

294
00:18:56,102 --> 00:19:00,664
a little bit of orange zest so it's like
the chocolate orange effect mate. Yeah

295
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,402
Nothing better than the old chocolate
orange. Right the last thing I need

296
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:09,036
I'm gonna put a little bit of butter yeah

297
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:12,946
and sort of you know it's about 20 grams of butter

298
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,522
but in layman's terms
about a small knob of butter really.

299
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,750
It's purely there to sort of enrichen it
and make it lovely and smooth

300
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,518
and just kind of...

301
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:23,662
Is it salted or unsalted?

302
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,353
That is actually slightly salted

303
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:29,433
funnily enough chocolate can always do
with a little little pinch of salt

304
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:32,036
cos it actually benefits from being
seasoned a little bit

305
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,139
Do you really not mind coming home in
the middle of the night and then cooking

306
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,296
I can't think of anything I'd like less

307
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:40,969
No, mate I've done worse - every time I go
round someone's house for a dinner party

308
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:45,777
I end up cooking even if I'm not cooking so
it makes no odds to me mate.

309
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,550
Listen that's gone all nice and smooth now

310
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,788
I like to put it in little expresso cups
and fill 'em up with chocolate

311
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,363
pour it in carefully - I'm sure
I'm gonna get chocolate everywhere.

312
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,462
It sets really smooth and
like just like the perfect thing

313
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,570
ah no I spilt a bit...

314
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:10,034
you know it's not hard and horrible
it's kind of very smooth and lovely.

315
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,804
Darling - we're starving...

316
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,541
I'm nearly done now but I've got to
put 'em in the fridge.

317
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,514
Did you have a nice evening Jools?

318
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,346
Yeah it was brilliant, we had a
right laugh, really good

319
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,886
I'm afraid we're really starving
no pressure

320
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:24,681
Oh that's alright

321
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:25,516
But can we have that now?

322
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,182
No no no - cos I've gotta put them in the
fridge but you can have that

323
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,496
Excellent - don't be long.

324
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:32,562
Easily pleased

325
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,993
Look what I've got...

326
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,206
You could serve them very happily as
they are, but I tell you what I do

327
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,938
I do like a little
little like lemon and palenter cookies

328
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,481
but any like little crunchy kind
of biscuits fantastic

329
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,710
cos then you put 'em on the
side of the old dish

330
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,320
so you have three biscuits a bit of this

331
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,889
teaspoon and it's nice cos you can
kind of use the biscuit

332
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,821
to sort of spoon it all up.

333
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,655
So there you go - about half an hour,
forty minutes - so...

334
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,727
< MIDNIGHT PAN
COOKED BREAKFAST >

335
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,997
This is like probably the most unchefy
thing I've ever done in my life right

336
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:20,305
basically I invented this when
I was about 16 years old yeah

337
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,208
and what is was we used to go

338
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,942
we got... and we used to go down to the
pubs and to have a drink right?

339
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,643
And we weren't horrible little reckless
little kids but we did you know

340
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:32,882
take part in a bit of underage drinking
and I had two very close friends that

341
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,118
used to live quite nearby and they always
used to come back for a bit of tucker.

342
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,664
So I developed this thing which I call now
midnight pan at breakfast

343
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,800
because you make it at midnight
and it's cooked in a pan

344
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,302
and it's breakfast kind of
I've got a really nice non stick pan

345
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,441
and that's quite important for
this recipe I think.

346
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,840
And I'm gonna put the sausages in there.

347
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,574
Is it very hot?

348
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:59,013
It's like a medium high heat - if it's too
hot everything gets kind of coloured

349
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,585
and cooked far too quick and
it's raw in the middle

350
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,450
well like I hate eggs when they're cooked
and they've got a black kind of

351
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:08,081
that horrible teary film on the bottom
and big bubbles you know

352
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,424
a medium sort of high constant heat's good.

353
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:15,362
Well I'm starting off with the sausages
cos they need more cooking yeah

354
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,129
so the second thing we need is er
yeah mushrooms.

355
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:22,741
So I've got some mushrooms
and tomatoes here yeah

356
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:27,143
so got these lovely like field
mushrooms which are fantastic

357
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,777
just turn it up a little bit.

358
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:35,015
Just - you can see - the sausages
are getting nice and brown

359
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,647
and I slice the mushrooms quite thick
about a centimetre thick yeah

360
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:43,224
sort of like that. And actually if
you cook field mushrooms well

361
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:47,354
and you don't put too many in a pan right
they taste so fantastic.

362
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:51,297
You can use any mushrooms you like
just don't use button mushrooms

363
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,870
which I think are like the worst
mushroom in the world

364
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,940
so as soon as you put 'em in
cos they're a little bit like sponges

365
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,007
toss 'em over and they get all that

366
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:02,580
they get all that lovely juice as
well and kind of make one layer.

367
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:06,377
What we doing next? I'm gonna cut
these tomatoes in half yeah

368
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:12,115
and I'm just gonna like put them
cut side down in the pan

369
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,288
and like all this is cooking at the same time.

370
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:18,123
Like this is the easiest fry up
cos you can see it all happening

371
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:19,821
and like as long as you get
your orders right

372
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,830
you know your sausages
cos they take longer

373
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,231
then your mushroom, then your tomato
then get your bacon in

374
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,998
and as long as you get that right it's
it's just easy peasy.

375
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:33,574
So I've got some nice bacon here
and this is dry cured bacon

376
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,340
pretty normal bacon from the supermarket
and you can feel it's dry

377
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,279
cos it's not got all the horrible water in
it doesn't shrink so much you know.

378
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,612
So like people do cook things
really badly and I've

379
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,917
honestly I've been to some of the poshest
hotels and had the most expensive

380
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,685
and the worst fry ups of my whole live.

381
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:53,625
You know - how at 28 quid for
a fry up and it's like...

382
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,494
You know I'd much rather go down
the greasy spoon

383
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,499
and get an alright one for 2 quid you now.

384
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,669
We want the bacon to be nice and
crispy so while that's happening

385
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:08,577
I've got the grill on and
I'm gonna do some nice thick chunky bread.

386
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:14,011
I like thick - you know thick toast
oh... it's beautiful. Here what you up to?

387
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,655
Just getting some orange for the girls.
How's it going?

388
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:21,156
Lovely! - Right so I'm gonna whack
the old toast in now

389
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:24,228
Babe can you get us some butter out of
the fridge and butter some toast for me?

390
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:29,161
I can get it out the fridge but I'm not
buttering it - I've got guests.

391
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,537
Do you hear that? - Did you hear that?

392
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:34,900
See this is what I'm in my house for...

393
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,098
What did she say?

394
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:41,640
No to be honest I'm looking after
the guests. Dear oh dear.

395
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,950
Look at the old tomatoes now - they've
gone nice and brown

396
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,411
yeah look at that.

397
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:57,727
Now this is the trick right

398
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:04,395
It's alright - it's me. Things like pine
nuts and toast I always forget.

399
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:08,631
And I burn... Right... get the toast in

400
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,967
So basically this is the clever bit now
what we have to do is jingle

401
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:16,012
and jungle everything up so every
little area side to side

402
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,378
middle to middle - everything's gotta a
bit of everything do you know what I mean.

403
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:24,746
What we're gonna do - we're gonna crack
the eggs in and just kind of angle it

404
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:29,121
so the whites kind of go
a little bit everywhere

405
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:33,827
and what we do is we do it
sort of from side to side and

406
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:38,800
what happens is it kind of sticks
everything together which sounds repulsive

407
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,940
but believe you me at 12 o'clock at
night it sounds beautiful.

408
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:50,206
And means that you can like cook it and
then put it on to a big plate and it holds

409
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,113
it's like a big frisbie mate.
It's like obviously very classy

410
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:58,784
and then you put a little bit
of pepper over the edge

411
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,421
yeah I'm really pleased with that
and then... oh Gawd...

412
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,264
Alright - right so toast nearly
burnt but it's blooming good

413
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,065
perfect cooking for me.

414
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:24,349
Right so - what happens now is now...
now the bottom's had a you know

415
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,508
it's perfect cooking - I'm just gonna
pop it under the grill for

416
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,951
literally 30 seconds just so the top
of the eggs get nice and coloured

417
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,590
so we're done - let's get...

418
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:41,559
Let's put the thing on there, lovely...

419
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:47,262
I keep the eggs nice and soft, and there
we go, that is the world's best fry up.

420
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,698
Don't tell me if I serve
that to the Queen right

421
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,538
I tell you what she will be chuffed me
old mate. Right girls come on...
