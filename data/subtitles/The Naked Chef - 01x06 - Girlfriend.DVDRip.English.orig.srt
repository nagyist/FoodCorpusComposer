1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,261
Naked's what I call my way of cooking.

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:05,563
What I cook in the restaurant isn't
what I cook at home.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,064
Cooking's gotta be a laugh.

4
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:08,866
It's gotta be simple

5
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,203
- it's gotta be tasty
- it's gotta be fun.

6
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,805
I suppose you could say it's stripping
down the recipe to its bare essentials.

7
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,047
No way it's not me it's the food.

8
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,878
You're up very early this morning Jamie.

9
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,169
Yeah it is a bit early isn't it -

10
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,908
no I've got my girlfriend Jules
coming round for lunch today -

11
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,484
I've been neglecting her
a bit lately so er -

12
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,881
down the flower market...
and get some nice flowers -

13
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,725
see if I can er -
make up some lost ground.

14
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,593
Are you gonna cook anything special?

15
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,594
Yeah yeah -
I've got a really nice fish dish -

16
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,996
a really good one and er -
I'm gonna do like baked chocolate tart -

17
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:13,265
which is like spot on so -
she's made for chocolate anyway so...

18
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,741
Supposed to be an aphrodisiac
isn't it chocolate?

19
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:36,095
Hi - could I have a couple of the white
and one of the light blue please.

20
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,868
Lovely - thank you very much -
cheers mate - bye.

21
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:02,149
< CHOCOLATE TRAT >

22
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,120
Right this chocolate tart
is a real cracker.

23
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:11,127
I've gotta sweet pastry tart shell -
in the freezer, completely frozen -

24
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,027
just gonna whack it in the oven for
about 10 minutes so it's slightly golden.

25
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,296
Er - cos it's frozen
it doesn't seem to shrink -

26
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:23,340
that's a bit of a trick and er -
I'll get on with the filling.

27
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,538
So I need some butter -
unsalted butter - I need 140 grams.

28
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,111
And I'll just guess it -

29
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:34,276
it's about normally about 3/4 of a pack
and I just weigh it to check.

30
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,653
Ooh bad guess. I'm losing it.
Let's try again.

31
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:48,594
That's right - so 140 grams of butter and
then I've got the chocolate here yeah.

32
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:49,932
It's dark chocolate.

33
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,764
It's 70% cocoa solids which is -

34
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,035
basically this is the best stuff
I could get in the supermarket.

35
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,873
So it's 150 grams of chocolate in there.

36
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,205
I'm gonna need a pinch of salt in there.

37
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,906
Just a little one.

38
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,016
When I worked in France I worked with
this really good French patisseriere

39
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,712
and he always used to say to me - er
when you cook with chocolate

40
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,789
you must always put er
a little pinch of salt in there

41
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,255
and it brings out the flavour
in the chocolate

44
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,433
which is like a chocolate bases
and er one we sold without

45
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,233
and it made all the difference -
it really made it lovely jubbly and yummy.

46
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,433
So - pinch of salt.

47
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,501
Cocoa.

48
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:37,616
I need 8 sort of levelish
tablespoons of er

49
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,447
here we are

50
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,180
eight levelish tablespoons of cocoa powder

51
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,651
and that's gonna give it
a really good bitterness.

52
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,616
Er - but by the time we've put
all the other stuff in there

53
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:52,030
it won't be horribly bitter -
it'll just there in the background.

54
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,592
So do you think
chocolate tart is something

55
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,961
you'd always make it you wanted
to impress a girlfriend?

56
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,935
I think it's a good thing for the girls
cos the girls tend to be er -

57
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,967
rather into the old chocolate you know.

58
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,176
Yeah definitely.

59
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,610
I think it's quite a romantic
thing you know - chocolate.

60
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,912
I'm just gonna put a little
bit of water in a pot.

61
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,656
Er - put it on a little heat.

62
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,890
And let it melt slowly.

63
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,653
Just forget about it -
give a stir every couple of minutes.

64
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,091
Butter, the chocolate, the cocoa,

65
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,062
the salt all mixed up -
be nice and shiny and lovely.

66
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,133
That's basically the base
for the cake yeah -

67
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,327
where all the flavour's at -
that's where it's all happening.

68
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:34,598
What we need to do now
is get the other side of the cake

69
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,867
which is kind of the lift and the texture.

70
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,470
And for that I've got four eggs -
large, free range.

71
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,814
Nice yellow yolks you know.

72
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,686
Now I need to put
200 grams of sugar in that.

73
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,611
Castor sugar.

74
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,784
Just whisk it up.

75
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,816
One dissolve the sugar and also
to get a little bit of air in the there

76
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:59,158
and give the whole texture sort of
like a really kind of light pale,

77
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,562
fluffy consistency.

78
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,064
So are you planning quite
a romantic day today for Juliette?

79
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,167
Yeah well kind of -

80
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,002
it's a bit of a miserable day
so I'm a bit annoyed at that.

81
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,474
But er - yeah
I'm gonna make a nice lunch -

82
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,805
go out for a nice walk.

83
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,004
Chill out.

84
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,149
Might do something nice in the evening.

85
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,308
Just spend a bit of time together really.

86
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,611
Bit of quality time.

87
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,585
Try and get in the old good books
again mate - get out the dog house.

88
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,153
Right, so that's nice and smooth yeah.

89
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,029
And then we've got
two little secret ingredients

90
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,529
which are a bit different from the norm.

91
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,865
Got some sour cream and some golden syrup.

92
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:46,838
And basically - the old sour cream
gives a lovely kind of acidity -

93
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,641
little bit of a sourness which is
beautiful - makes all the difference.

94
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:53,081
Lightens it up a little bit and
I want three tablespoons of that.

95
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,380
You can use creme freche if you wanted.

96
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,285
The sour cream's slightly more yoghurty.

97
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,154
Creme freche is probably a bit more creamy

98
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:05,093
but they both have that really wonderful
sort of acidity which is lovely.

99
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:10,292
And then we've got this golden syrup -
nice traditional sort of ingredient.

100
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,864
Quite old fashioned really?

101
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:12,629
Quite old fashioned yeah -

102
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,171
but I tell you what this -
it gives this tart yeah?

103
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:20,278
It gives it a nice kind of toffeeness
which is good for flavour

104
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,108
but also you know gives it
that little bit of a chew.

105
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,008
And I like all that.

106
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,153
Makes a bit of a difference and
three tablespoonsish of that.

107
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,680
Must be fantasic having
a boyfriend who can cook?

108
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:31,949
You reckon?

109
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,820
You tell that to my girlfriend.

110
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,790
She just thinks I'm a bit strange.

111
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,495
The other day she came walked in
and found me watching -

112
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,558
the telly was on and
she found me watching the rotisserie

113
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,533
and the roast chicken just going around.

114
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,364
She thought I was really
weird and very sad.

115
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,272
So just mix this up together.

116
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,145
Just until it's smooth basically.

117
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,282
Right - so that's all done.
That's all mixed up.

118
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,578
Let's just check on the old choc.

119
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,388
...can use this spoon again.

120
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,355
Nearly there.

121
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,265
So this is where all the chocolate
is really like mega flavours.

122
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,562
Just lovely and shiny.

123
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:24,141
Right so now I will get my spatula
which is a bit of a handy tool in er -

124
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,144
in the dessert situation because it means
you can get everything out of the bowl

125
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:32,341
and why it's important to get everything
out of the bowl is cos like desserts

126
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,385
and baking and stuff is a bit more
like chemistry as opposed to cooking.

127
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,582
Now whereas you're doing sort of roast and
meals and stuff you can be a bit more -

128
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,319
you can personalise it
a bit more freely and do

129
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,259
what you like but quite important
to weigh everything you know

130
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,366
what I mean otherwise you find
that either doesn't taste as nice

131
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,263
or it hasn't risen or something like that.

132
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,128
Which is always a bit of a downer.

133
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,038
Ever had any terrible disasters?

134
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,835
Oh mate - I've had so many disasters
you wouldn't believe - I've lost count.

135
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,806
I've had so many bad ones.

136
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,246
Yeah - I mean
I make all my mistakes at home.

137
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,784
I try to anyway.

138
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:12,249
Right - that's looking good -
right - tart shell.

139
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:19,024
So the tart shell I put in
for about 10 minutes I suppose -

140
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,424
just until it's slightly golden
and we know it's just about cooked.

141
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,203
But we're gonna plunk
this straight in there now

142
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,007
and it's gonna go mad - absolutely mad.

143
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:36,240
The chocolate's gonna puff up -
look absolutely pukka.

144
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,243
Just carefully put it in the old oven -
I normally spill it at this stage.

145
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,319
And I cook it for about 40 minutes
at about 150 - be spot on.

146
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,385
< RADISH AND FENNEL SALAD >

147
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,896
I'm gonna make a really,
really fantastic salad -

148
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,761
it's so simple I'm almost
embarrassed to tell you about it.

149
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,267
But basically it's
a combination of raddish -

150
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,667
quite mustardy and fennel -
really nice and aniseedy -

151
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,434
really like crisp - little gem of a salad.

152
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,668
What's I'm gonna do right -
get myself a bowl.

153
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,739
I got these from the supermarket.

154
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,382
It's a really good thing cos like
just lately in the supermarket

155
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,313
I mean like over the last 2 years, er -

156
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,581
like we've got loads and
loads of radishes all a sudden.

157
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,745
Like we used to have
to have the boring old round ones.

158
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,323
Now we've got oval ones and we've got
oval ones with sort of white bits

159
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,960
and they look funky and
some are really mustardy

160
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,186
and some aren't quite so mustardy.

161
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,820
You get those big er - what they called -
mouly sort of like the Asian type ones -

162
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:27,795
black ones, white ones.

163
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:28,558
No it's just brilliant.

164
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,632
I think they're terribly,

165
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,895
terribly underrated and really,
really tasty.

166
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,401
So what I do is basically
these have got lovely leaves on - er -

167
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,868
I've given 'em a wahs.

168
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,409
There's no dirt of anything on -

169
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,639
I just cut the stalks off
about an inch above the raddish

170
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,749
and as far as
I'm concerned that is perfect.

171
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,906
I wanna eat all of that -

172
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,552
you know there's no point
in chopping in all away

173
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,654
and then what I do is
just slice off one end

174
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,551
and then I roll it onto that flat edge

175
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,954
and then just slice
as fine as I possibly can.

176
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,122
Is it something that goes
very well with fish - this?

177
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,423
Oh you wouldn't believe
how good it goes with fish.

178
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:04,502
If you imagine like the nice
sort of fragrant tasty old fish

179
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,231
and then this kind of zing
really nice sort of crunch salad.

180
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,932
I mean to me that
just makes complete sense.

181
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,005
And that's what cooking's
all about really you know -

182
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,171
you don't just do things because they're
fashionable or cos you're told to -

183
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,011
you do things cos you like to eat them
together do you know what I mean?

184
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,248
I've got some leaves here.

185
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,719
Right - and you just
pick out any dodgy ones -

186
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,450
I won't want all of them
but I'm gonna keep about half of them.

187
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,527
Just er - finely slice 'em.

188
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,390
They're really tasty as well.

189
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,361
And we always chuck 'em away in England.

190
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,124
I don't know why -
nothing wrong with it at all.

191
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,431
They're quite like sorrel -
almost you know quite a fresh flavour.

192
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,470
What does sorrel taste like?

193
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,903
You know when you put
a battery on your tongue -

194
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,442
gives you that kind of zing -

195
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,636
well it's kind of like
a very light version of that -

196
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,805
it's quite zingy -
quite juicy, quite fresh.

197
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,144
And er - basically quite nice.

198
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,412
And I'll show you these old fennels -
look at these.

199
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,351
Absolutely fantastic.

200
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,148
You can do anything with this.

201
00:10:59,325 --> 00:10:59,757
You can roast it.

202
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,825
You can stew it - you can pan fry it.

203
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,756
You can do what you like with it.

204
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,156
It's really, really fantastic.

205
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,232
But in salads they're brilliant and
I'm just gonna take the old bottom off.

206
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,228
Right - and normally you can
pick that old bit off -

207
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,063
put it in stocks or whatever.

208
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,935
In actual fact I'll keep that - er -
and put that in the fish.

209
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:21,570
It'll add loads of flavour and then
round the top just take it off and er -

210
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,911
I've got these bits
left over in actual fact

211
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,210
I'll put those in the old fish as well.

212
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,583
That's - some people chuck that away
and it makes me really angry.

213
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:34,214
It's like the herby part and they're
absolutely fantastic - really delicate -

214
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,452
really good looking -
really fresh looking,

215
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,857
so we'll keep them for salad.

216
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,193
What I'll do is put
the old fennel on a flat edge

217
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,804
and just slice it
as thinly as you possibly can.

218
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,534
Just keep turning it onto its flat edge
and you just get really nice big shaves.

219
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,838
And if you've got one
of the mandolin things

220
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,573
you can use one of those - be bit careful.

221
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,209
The raddish and the fennel -

222
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,750
they're quite strong flavours
aren't they both them?

223
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,854
Yeah - well I mean
I think they're fantastic.

224
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:03,954
I mean the thing is right

225
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,320
sometimes flavours like have a bit
of a ruck do you know what I mean

226
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,653
and it doesn't work,

227
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,819
but quite frankly I reckon these are
like best mates do you know what I mean.

228
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,794
They have a real good laugh together
and I think it really works.

229
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,801
And you know sometimes it works
like that and sometimes it doesn't.

230
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,872
But whop all that in there.

231
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,534
The old fennel tops just
roughly or finely chopped.

232
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,271
Chuck 'em in there and
then I want some oil -

233
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,679
just about two or three tablespoons -

234
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,116
basically just enough
to cover what you've got.

235
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:40,382
Er - I probably need about a lemon -
one lemon for this - er -

236
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,292
but you do it to taste normally.

237
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,987
I don't want any pips they're horrible.

238
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:52,730
Get that in there and then at a guess
I wanna good pinch of salt.

239
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:58,505
A good pinch of pepper and
then just mix it all together.

240
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:04,274
And the colours you know I can feel
it's lovely and crunchy and actually -

241
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,678
just get a plate -

242
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,750
Get all this nicely mixed up
and let's have a little taste.

243
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,526
Ah yeah - that's -

244
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,426
I know this is the most simple
recipe in the whole wide world,

245
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:24,160
but to me things like that, that work
just sum cooking up all for me -

246
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:24,927
especially at home,

247
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,971
you want things to be simple,
you want really good results.

248
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,232
And I'm just well chuffed with that.

249
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,602
That's what cooking's all about.

250
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:31,572
And so quick?

251
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,871
So quick mate - I'm excited.

252
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,448
See you after long time -
it's nearly 3 weeks.

253
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,590
You look smashing.

254
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,282
Really nice you look.

255
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,189
So you ask me to make something
really nice for you?

256
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,490
Yes mate - I'd like some
of your lovely bread -

257
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,825
just a little loaf or something.

258
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,598
Oh my God!

259
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:40,578
You always do exactly the same thing every
- always go over the top.

260
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,380
You pick him up and you say Juliette...

261
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,618
Because I'm busy and you know
you're busy as well...

262
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,820
That's beautiful mate.

263
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,030
- Okay look after yourself - chow.

264
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,793
Take care.

265
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,702
Chow Bella!

266
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,391
< POTATOES AND DILL >

267
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,126
I wanna do some new potatoes
to go with the fish.

268
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,460
I'm doing it really really simply

269
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,571
but there's a real kind of knack
of doing if really, really good.

270
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,037
And what I did - I got my new potatoes

271
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,732
and I give 'em a scrub
with a green scrubber -

272
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,471
so that kind of layer of skin has come
off and it kinda leaves it a bit rough.

273
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:52,811
So when you put all the lovely oil and
herbs and lemon juice on later it just...

274
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,976
it just coats it -
sucks it all up and just -

275
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,123
the all round potato tastes
absolutely beautiful

276
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,554
so what I've done is
I've just boiled them once -

277
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,593
after I've scrubbed them
in salted boiling water.

278
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,026
And I've got some really nice dill.

279
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,565
All I do is just pick off
all the nice bits,

280
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,397
get rid of the horrible fat stalks.

281
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,637
Tell you what is was so nice of Genoa?

282
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,331
To do that you know -
bake the bread for me.

283
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,169
He's done it for me -
he does it for me all the time.

284
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,742
But Italians are so romantic and you tell
him you're cooking for your girlfriend

285
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,246
and they start doing heart
shapes and big ones and -

286
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,346
kind of makes me feel a bit
bad about all the times

287
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,884
I've stitched him up at work.

288
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,481
I remember once we had a big shipment
of the white truffles come in

289
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,522
cos he was a mushroom man -

290
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,661
he used to deal with all that
and they're like 1400 a kilo

291
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,127
and he was kind of brushing them and
weighing them to make sure that ship -

292
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,858
you know the shipment was er -
you know all above board and so on -

293
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,696
the old invoice - and the phone
went and he went to answer it

294
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,933
and I went and swapped about a 1000 worth
of truffles for new potatoes and er -

295
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,774
when he came back he started realising
that things weren't quite right

296
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,914
and he started sniffing 'em and groping
'em and started swearing in Italian

297
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,572
and I disappeared the fridge
kind of like really laughing

298
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,616
looking through the kind
of joint in the door.

299
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,879
Then after about three minutes
of that he turned round

300
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,523
and saw me like really like
laughing my head off

301
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,818
in the corner in the fridge and er -

302
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,019
ran over and said
don't ever do that again -

303
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,685
you nearly give me a heart attack!

304
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,591
Oh God I feel bad.

305
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,400
Right so just chop this - er - dill up -

306
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:27,611
...kind of rough and then
just chuck it in an old bowl.

307
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,413
See how these are going.

308
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,651
Yeah - the nice thing about
really good new potatoes is that

309
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,415
they should be almost creamy -
do you know what I mean -

310
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:46,324
these are really... good - mmm -

311
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,730
Shake off all the steam.

312
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,165
But we'll let 'em go for a minute

313
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,432
but while they're still hot
we're gonna dress them

314
00:17:56,608 --> 00:18:00,271
and that's just gonna make 'em taste
so good you wouldn't believe.

315
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,643
And the funny thing is it's really simple
things like a little bit of scrubbing,

316
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,579
dressing 'em while they're hot -
things like that,

317
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,209
that make things taste so much better
and people always go what did you do?

318
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,882
So you think it's the little things
in cooking that make the difference?

319
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,651
I think it's the little things and
the little bit of care that counts.

320
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,726
Just put 'em in - bit of dill -
squeeze over a lemon.

321
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,872
Olive oil -just a little lug -
enough to coat.

322
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,699
Salt and pepper.

323
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,742
And just dress it - or toss it -
mix it up - whatever you want to call it.

324
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,177
Would you use any other herbs
other than just dill?

325
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,819
Oh God yeah -
I mean like - things like dill

326
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:45,445
and mint are like the classic sort
of new potato partners you know -

327
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:52,291
but things like parsley when it's really
good and fresh er - basil's lovely.

328
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,393
You could do coriander
if you're in the mood.

329
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,433
Just anything -
any sort of delicate herb really.

330
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:03,330
< BAKED FISH IN FOIL >

331
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,144
This is an absolutely
fantastic way to cook fish.

332
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,941
The trick is that is we make
a tin foil envelope and we cook -

333
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,345
that means we cook everything in it -

334
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,316
got the herbs, got the fish -
got the lemon juice -

335
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,320
we've got the oil and
all these things cook away

336
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,253
and basically you've got
your main course meal

337
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,052
and you've got the sauce all made for you.

338
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:27,262
Roll out a bit of tin foil
four times bigger than your fish right.

339
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,961
Basically it's because

340
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,461
we're gonna double wrap

341
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,004
it just to be safe you know
so it's a nice thick bag.

342
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,107
Fold it in half like that

343
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,139
and then I've got a really nice fish.

344
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,979
It's a lovely sea bass.

345
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,011
And I went to the fishmonger
and I've had it scaled

346
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,883
and gutted for me so I haven't
got to do any of that malarkey.

347
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:55,019
It's about 2 pound which is more
than enough for me and Jules.

348
00:19:56,562 --> 00:20:00,396
You normally - you lose about a pound
like at least half in bones and stuff.

349
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,396
Do you always make this dish with
whole fish or could you use steaks?

350
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,095
Oh you could use whatever you like -
you can use cuts -

351
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,838
I like to use whole fish
when I possibly can

352
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:14,877
because all the kind of bones within it
kind of help to make the meat really tasty

353
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,743
and the juice really tasty
and juicy as well you know.

354
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,920
So I'm must scoring it at
an angle - not deeply at all -

355
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,716
just a little bit thinly
and what I'm gonna do is

356
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,756
I'm gonna get a good pinch of salt

357
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,893
and I'm gonna sprinkle that
on the fish on both sides -

358
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,465
I'm gonna kind of go against the grain
and push that into those gaps.

359
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,795
And do that on both sides.

360
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,530
And that's to get in all
that flavour right in there.

361
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:46,338
And then a good pinch of pepper
on both sides and do exactly the same -

362
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,809
just push that right in there
and you know that -

363
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,505
that's what it's all about really.

364
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,946
Little things like that make
things really, really tasty.

365
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:58,647
So what I need now is kind of the really
delicate kind of flavour enhancers

366
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,691
and you can do what you like
you know let your imagination take -

367
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,593
take you really,
but I've got some bay leaves.

368
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,991
I've got this red onion.

369
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,526
I've got these bits of fennel

370
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,328
that were left over from the salad
which were a bit stringy.

371
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:17,274
And some fresh basil which is good -
really, really nice basil.

372
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,213
Now what I'm gonna do
is finely chop this fennel.

373
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,874
And we probably won't eat this fennel -

374
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,519
you could but we probably won't eat it

375
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:33,021
because you know I just want it
to enhance the sauce really.

376
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:37,453
And then all you've gotta do is just
mix it all up a bit and then make -

377
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,530
lay it all out -
kind of equally over here.

378
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:43,958
Pat it all down.

379
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,696
And then put the fish on top of it -
like just like a trivet?

380
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,897
If you're roasting a bit of meat
or something like that.

381
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,769
And just push it to one end.

382
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:51,704
Why do you do that?

383
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,276
To keep the bottom of the -

384
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,913
the bottom side of the
bass off all the liquor

385
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,673
and the juice cos you don't want it -

386
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:01,285
you don't want the top sort of steaming
lovely and bottom kind of boiling away.

387
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,988
And I'm gonna peel -
peel an onion and slice it really thinly

388
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,594
and these red onions seem
to be nice and - and sweet.

389
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,856
And the thing about red onion as well -

390
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,558
when you cut it quite thinly
and it's a really delicate taste.

391
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,463
Just break it up a little bit
and just kind put it all around -

392
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,439
and I tell you what we will do -

393
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,235
we'll put a little bit
of salt in the cavity -

394
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,002
in the actual cavity of the fish -

395
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:31,138
just before we put anything inside it
and then we'll shove some onion in there.

396
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,744
And just push all these
things tight next to it

397
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,013
so they all kind of hug in it really.

398
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,886
And then what I want is
I've got lovely basil -

399
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,694
you know I wanna stuff that cavity
right full of lovely fresh herbs

400
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,298
and keep the stalks on -
you can bruise 'em

401
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,935
or snap 'em or break 'em just
to get the flavours going a bit.

402
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:56,166
But just stuff that right in there -
full you know like well OTT you know.

403
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,332
But just imagine all those
flavours in the belly -

404
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,308
all kind of steaming
as it cooks into the belly

405
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,914
and then you know all this
around it making that lovely juice

406
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,413
which is so tasty.

407
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:09,384
And then pick all these bits of bay leaf -
just kind of rip 'em over.

408
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,656
What other combinations of fish
and flavouring could you make?

409
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,759
There's so many - you can just let your -
just let your imagination go wild.

410
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:20,330
I mean - you can do like Monk fish
studded with anchovies - rosemary,

411
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,023
white wine, butter - you can do...?

412
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,603
...with cherry tomatoes and olives -
you can do Salmon with asparagus and mint.

413
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:31,505
You can do - you can do Cod with chick
peas and chillie and lime and parsley.

414
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,303
You can do - give me another thing?

415
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:33,944
Trout?

416
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:37,548
Give me trout - smashed up thyme
and lemon - very, very nice.

417
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,583
You know all wrapped up in a bag -
goodness - cook 'em away.

418
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,720
They're all fantastic
like that but you know

419
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:47,052
if you like two things together then think
well can I incorporate it into the bag.

420
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,921
I mean this can be a simple
or as complex as you want.

421
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,461
I mean if I just did this
with like flat leaf parsley

422
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,997
and lemon it would still
be gorgeous you know.

423
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,189
And no washing up either?

424
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,201
No just chuck it all away - no washing up.

425
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:03,971
And I like that cos I - you know
I'm not partial to scrubbing I must admit.

426
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,871
Nice lug of olive oil.

427
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:12,006
And what we want is
a good knob of butter -

428
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,276
about a good two,
three ounce knob of butter.

429
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,353
You can put it on it - inside of it -
er - you know around it - whatever.

430
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:26,122
And then the final thing that
makes it really really work -

431
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,901
is about two or three lemons -

432
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,470
two juicy ones of three
if they're not so juice.

433
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,730
And this lemon's gonna -
well it's gonna flavour it

434
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,172
but it's also gonna melt
with the old butter

435
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,604
to make the most outrageous
sauce you can imagine.

436
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,807
Get it all on there.

437
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:50,684
All done -just push the
old fish forward a little bit.

438
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,383
You can't really go wrong here
unless you're really rough and you -

439
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,584
and you pierce the tin foil.

440
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,924
So fold it over in half -
just like you would like an envelope or -

441
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,089
or a Christmas present
or something like that.

442
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,331
And push the two ends together

443
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,273
and then really tightly and firmly fold

444
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,975
cos you don't want this to leak.

445
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,576
Right - and then you go to one end -

446
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,544
just until you can start
to feel the flesh you know.

447
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,419
And then the last one

448
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,158
right

449
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,955
and then the last trick is just where
you've folded it just kind of bring it up

450
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,291
so it's not kind of
flopping onto the tray -

451
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,367
so there aren't any little gaps
then it won't escape.

452
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,067
Right and that's it -
all done - all raring to go.

453
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,636
Just gent... very, very carefully -
you don't want to pierce it now -

454
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:50,645
put it onto the old tray - in the oven -
220 degrees - 8 minutes per pound.

455
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:54,751
Two pound fish - 16 minutes -
so whack it in the oven -

456
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,218
when it comes out the oven
the little trick is actually that -

457
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,747
let it rest for about
three or four minutes.

458
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,316
Let it chill out.

459
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,962
And that just makes it taste a lot better.

460
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,098
Take it out to the table -
it's all puffed up.

461
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,358
Whip it open - steam ...
