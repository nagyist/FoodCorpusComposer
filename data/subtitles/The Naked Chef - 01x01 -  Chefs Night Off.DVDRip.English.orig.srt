1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,429
Naked's what I call my way of cooking.

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,901
What I cook in the restaurant isn't
what I cook at home.

3
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,165
Cooking's gotta be a laugh.

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,069
It's gotta be simple

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,574
- it's gotta be tasty
- it's gotta be fun.

6
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:17,178
I suppose you could say it's stripping
down the recipe to its bare essentials.

7
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,416
Now way it's not me.
It's food.

8
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,905
So big boy are you going to
come round tonight or what?

9
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,015
Sure.

10
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,515
What's happening are you cooking dinner.

11
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,153
Yeah but I mean I could really do
with a bit of a hand.

12
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,779
I'm going to do like this Thai...
scallops, clams and stuff.

13
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,420
And er
- I'm going to do roast leg of lamb,

14
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,994
just roast potatoes and
stuff and some baked fruit.

15
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,529
Lovely - who's coming?

16
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:11,268
I've asked Jeff - I've asked Brenley
- and er - the other guys from the cafe.

17
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,736
I've got my old table football out mate
- do you fancy your chances?

18
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,776
FA cup finals
- just gotta get out of here...

19
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,758
Right I'll see you
- well come round as soon as you can yeah

20
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,159
- take care.

21
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:45,001
< ROAST LAMB >

22
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,797
I really really like roast lamb

23
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:52,638
- I mean a roast anything but I love
roast lamb and I do do it quite often.

24
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,947
My mum used to do it a lot as well
but er - you know

25
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,018
- I love it with just like Malvern
sea salt over and roasted in the oven

26
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:00,948
- that's lovely.

27
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,782
But I kind of get bored with doing
the same thing all the time

28
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,220
so I'm always trying to have
like new ways of getting sort

29
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,689
of flavour right stuck in there.

30
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:12,230
So first things first
- what I want to do is get a knife

31
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:17,131
and stick the knife down
next to the bone at one end

32
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,636
and just push your finger in there night
- so that just makes a bit of room.

33
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,770
And then - at this end do the same again

34
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:29,040
- right next to the bone
- stick your finger in there.

35
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,480
Then in about sort of
about 8 places around the lamb

36
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,113
you want to get your knife
about an inch and a half okay

37
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,622
and stick it in at an angle okay
and then shove your hand in there

38
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,054
- your finger in there.

39
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:44,196
And just do that kind of randomly
but kind of equally

40
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,356
and let's do it
on the other side as well.

41
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,532
One more I reckon.

44
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,833
Now we're talking about flavour here
- so what we'll do

45
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,946
- I've got this sage here
- I'm going to rip off just half of it

46
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,083
so it's so it's just the leaves
and I'm gonna keep that for later

47
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,119
and then this half I'm going to put in a
pestle and mortar with a clove of garlic.

48
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,821
It seems a very simple thing to do
if you've got kind of chefs coming round

49
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,156
- I'd expect you to do something
incredibly posh and fussy I suppose.

50
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,888
Yeah well the funny thing is

51
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,125
- is if you imagine chefs like the hours
they do and stuff like that right

52
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,762
- it's almost in their own time
they wanna kind of be a little bit

53
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,773
more sort of relaxed
about it you know what I mean?

54
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,902
So I know as long as I give them a really
nice cooked piece of lamb you know

55
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,741
- they're gonna be well chuffed
and a glass of wine.

56
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,177
They're gonna be over the moon.

57
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,808
So with this sage, salt and garlic
- just smash it up.

58
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,279
And that'll kind of get
all the flavours really going.

59
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,756
And you can smell all that
- do you know what I mean?

60
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:52,296
- It's just so fragrant - yeah.

61
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:57,859
Right lovely and leave the rest of the
sage that you've got left over whole okay?

62
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,505
And then we're gonna have some olive oil

63
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:04,803
- about you know 2/3 tablespoons
just to sort

64
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,913
- oil will help the oils in the flavour
in the leaves to come out.

65
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,312
And er - some lemon juice
- give it a little bit of that so

66
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,313
- just squeeze that in there.

67
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,779
Get rid of the pips

68
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,225
- so you've got your lemon juice
in there and just chop up

69
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,931
- roughly chop up this rosemary
that I've got with it.

70
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,927
Just mush it up in you hands and

71
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:33,436
- the first thing I'm gonna do is get a
big handful and rub it all over the meat

72
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,699
- so straight away
the skin's gonna be tasty.

73
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,569
Lovely Jubbly.

74
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,735
Right - then we put that next to it
and get everything else out here.

75
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:40,911
Right our job now

76
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,310
- is in these cuts that
we've made kind of push

77
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,247
all these lovely herbs
all the garlicky lemon stuff

78
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,545
- get it right in these holes.

79
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,780
Push it right down and there's
a little bit of salt in there as well

80
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,653
- so you're seasoning it
inside a little bit which is great.

81
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,227
Down the little holes that you've made
- and that end up here

82
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,991
- next to the bone which has gone down
about four inches you know

83
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,064
- it's right in there.

84
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,462
Loads of flavour.

85
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,897
Really get stuck in there.

86
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:09,334
Sound like David Bellamy
...shove it all in there.

87
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,967
What else could you use
to flavour the lamb?

88
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:12,804
Oh my God - I mean

89
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,244
- basically at the end of the day like
all cooking should be you know use

90
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,012
- whatever you like with lamb
you should do but I mean things

91
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,710
I've done is kind of get some nice,

92
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,221
really dried apricots with like
smashed up thyme and butter

93
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,086
- I mean that works beautiful.

94
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,526
Things like you know - simple things
like anchovies and rosemary work so well.

95
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,892
They just work really well.

96
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,626
Now you've got all that flavour in there
and the secret ingredient

97
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,770
which I think is a thing called pancetta

98
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:43,034
and basically it's the Italian
version of our streaky bacon.

99
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,273
All you need really is
about three or four slices.

100
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,944
And just shove it down the gaps you know.

101
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:49,979
Where do you get it from?

102
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,674
You can get it from the Deli
- you can get it from the supermarket

103
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,717
- I mean it's all over the place.

104
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,285
It's got a slight smokiness to it

105
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,482
- you don't want loads of smokiness
but it's got a slight smokiness to it

106
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,127
and that's really really nice.

107
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,695
And it works with the sage
as well you know.

108
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,155
Get it in there.

109
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,926
Lovely.

110
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,263
So now we've done that
I'm just gonna put a bit of salt on top

111
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:16,465
- it's nice to have a nice salty skin
and er - basically that's it done.

112
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,973
I know it's gonna be really really tasty

113
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,238
- all we have to do now is take care of it
and take care of it in the cooking.

114
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:25,407
So into a really really hot oven
- about 250 full whack.

115
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:26,950
I'm gonna get the leg of lamb.

116
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,179
I'm gonna put it straight
onto the bars right.

117
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,589
And put the empty tin underneath
to catch all the goodness

118
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,627
and all the drips and all that kind
of marmity lovely jubbly stuff.

119
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,229
How long do you cook lamb for?

120
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,561
Well I really like to cook the lamb
so it's kind of pink

121
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,430
- not bloody pink
but kind of pink pink and er

122
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,767
- to do that I cook it
for about 13 minutes per pound

123
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,899
and with an additional 20 minutes
of cooking at the end of that

124
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,603
and then what the trick is
then is to rest it

125
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,112
and I'm par cooking some potatoes now

126
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,917
and when they're ready to go in
after about 20 minutes when

127
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,748
- you know it's coloured u
- started to colour up nicely

128
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,858
- I'll turn it down and I'll put the
potatoes in with all that lovely goodness.

129
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:13,891
These potatoes I've just boiled
for like five minutes.

130
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,702
Right and you wanna kind of chop up
all the outsides

131
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,328
- so kind of just toss 'em about a bit
- give 'em a good old shake

132
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,872
and then what I'm gonna do
is just get 'em in the oven

133
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,170
- where all that goodness has just
been dripping in the old tray

134
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,040
- loads and loads of goodness.

135
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,420
And just chuck in 'em there.

136
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,554
Yeah - smell it - oh it's gonna be mad.

137
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,590
And just put a little bit of extra
rosemary in there - cos that won't hurt.

138
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,253
And then give 'em a good old shake.

139
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,558
Cos you wanna get them coated.

140
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,397
It's going to crispen up straight away
- all nice and fluffy

141
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,733
- perfect meat - perfect roast potatoes.

142
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:59,334
< RED ONIONS >

143
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,537
I don't really understand
why people don't use onions

144
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,909
as a vegetable as they are really
do you know what I mean?

145
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,348
Cos they always think of them as a base
for things like soups and stuff

146
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,454
but like with any sort of roasted

147
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:13,183
or grilled meats this
particularly dish is superb

148
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,893
and all you have to do
is sort of remove the

149
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,154
- a little bit of the core,

150
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,494
the base to make a flat edge and
then at the top just cut down

151
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,227
until about a centimetre and
a half away from the bottom

152
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,495
so you don't cut it into quarters

153
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,197
- so you've got it like that
but you don't go all the way down.

154
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,637
You only go down to about there

155
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,042
and then just take off maybe just the
skin of maybe the first layer of flesh

156
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,578
but nice and tender.

157
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,649
I'm using red onions cos I like them.

158
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,582
They're a good - you want them
all the same sort of size er

159
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,381
- and they're quite easily available

160
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,490
and when you cook them
they're lovely and sweet.

161
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,923
But things like shallots and
stuff like that are ideal as well.

162
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,755
I wouldn't use the white onions
because they're very big and you can't

163
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,366
- I can't really imagine that
on someone's plate you know

164
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,602
- like one whole onion that size.

165
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,532
But I mean I do it quite often cos
my blooming dad keeps giving me onions

166
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,675
from the garden and keeps tying
them all up like the French boy

167
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,436
and I've got onions everywhere so...

168
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,404
have to make use of them
otherwise I feel guilty.

169
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,484
Get a pestle and mortar.

170
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,517
Thyme and butter.

171
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,213
Butter's at room temperature.

172
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,222
Nice handful of fresh thyme in.

173
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,155
Have you got any tips for avoiding crying
actually when you're chopping onions?

174
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:29,733
No - I quite like to have a good cry
at work cos er

175
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,394
- you know you can get all your emotions
out and you just pretend it's the onions.

176
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:37,542
What we're going to do now
is put a good important

177
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,168
- good pinch of salt in there
and we're going to smash it up

178
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,111
- and funnily enough even though
thyme's quite a kind of woody herb

179
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,114
when you smash it up it's quite juicy.

180
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,186
Right that's lovely and smashed up and
the butter - I'll get a bowl actually.

181
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,928
So - put all the thyme in the bowl

182
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,629
- you can put a squeeze of lemon juice
in there actually would be nice.

183
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,137
I suppose you need about four,
four and a half ounces of butter

184
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,303
- and just kind of squelch
it in your hand.

185
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:21,510
And then squelch in the thyme
- There's nothing hard in it

186
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,014
- and that's gonna to be lovely
with the old onion.

187
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,819
But look just open up the onion

188
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,160
- and what we're gonna do is put
a little knob of butter inside it

189
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,492
and really push it in and down the cracks.

190
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,827
Could you use different herbs or
other flavourings in that butter?

191
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,562
Oh God yeah - I mean

192
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,763
- I think herb butter's something that

193
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,602
not a lot of people use
for some strange reason.

194
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,244
Right I mean you've always got
a bit of extra butter kicking about

195
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,276
- and you've always got kind of

196
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:51,007
- when I guy herbs there's always like
a little bit that I don't use you know

197
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,949
- mash it up - you can do any flavour
you like and just put it in the freezer.

198
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,713
It keeps for absolutely ages.

199
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,551
So basically you smear it
over all of them.

200
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,358
Top all the other up.

201
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,061
And I think the nice thing about this

202
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,223
- as these cook right
the butter's gonna melt.

203
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,302
And it's gonna kind of drip right
into the bottom of the onion

204
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,267
where you've made those scores and

205
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:18,035
- and you know it's just gonna
give it all that flavour

206
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,269
and there's salt in there too
so it's gonna season the onion.

207
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:26,715
What I do now is just put - sprinkle
some sea salt on the bottom and er

208
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,420
- what this helps
- just helps them stand up and also

209
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,387
where you just trimmed off the bottom it
will just suck up a little bit of salt

210
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,493
which is lovely cos it helps season
it around that area

211
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,026
which you haven't cut down to.

212
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,964
All I have to do to that
now is cook it for like half an hour

213
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,593
- 35 minutes at about 220 degrees
just until they kind of

214
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,206
- kind of sag a little bit
but they'll keep their shape.

215
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,533
Hello John are you alright?

216
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,107
Yeah what do you fancy?

217
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,506
Oh - mate - I'm after some scallops

218
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,379
- oh they look good...
brilliant - hand me those.

219
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,649
I'll get myself nine is that alright?

220
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:03,138
Cheers mate - a bit of parsley
- lovely - anything that's free.

221
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,609
That's the lot mate thank you very much.

222
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,824
< BAKED FRUIT >

223
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:25,364
So for dessert I'm gonna do baked fruit
which is so easy you wouldn't believe.

224
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,403
Wicked fruit -
I'm gonna make some vanilla

225
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,736
- vanilla sugar which is outrageous and
I'm gonna make some mascaponi cream

226
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,140
which is just really moreish and gorgeous.

227
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,609
I mean all I've done right

228
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,975
- is I've taken the bottoms
off the strawberries

229
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,051
- I've quartered and de-cored the peaches
and put a bit of lemon juice over them

230
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,744
- cos they get a bit dark if you don't.

231
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:46,722
Er - I've de pipped the cherries
with an olive pipper.

232
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,519
I've sliced up the rhubarb nice and thing.

233
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,098
Er - and with the stoned fruits
I just did 'em in half

234
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,358
and just pulled 'em apart like an avocado.

235
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,766
Got rid of the pip and these figs
I'm just gonna sort of slice

236
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,371
but not quite down
to the bottom like a star

237
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,738
and then you just squeeze it like
that and they look lovely.

238
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,937
But there's nothing stopping you just
using singular fruit and if something

239
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,207
- the idea is if you're going down
the market and you pick up something

240
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,180
that's really juicy then buy it
- you know.

241
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,547
Anyway let me show you
how to make this vanilla sugar.

242
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:22,457
I've got these vanilla pods from my Deli-
and I've got a kilo of sugar

243
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,956
- just normal castor sugar and these
vanilla pods are pretty amazing right

244
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,189
- you can buy 'em in anywhere

245
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,357
- get 'em in any sort of supermarket
or anything like that.

246
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,993
But when you buy 'em look for
like soft sticky ones like these.

247
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,730
These are pretty amazing.

248
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,476
And all I do is chop these
into about five bits - er

249
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,942
- just to make less work
for your old magimix

250
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,977
- pull this out - chuck 'em in there.

251
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,256
And like as soon as you open it
the smell is completely amazing.

252
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,793
Chuck all your sugar in there.

253
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,898
Whizz it up and you're going to see
the sugar go like from white

254
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,162
- sparkling white to the most
amazing kind of ashy colour.

255
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,608
Right - and when you think that's
- you've given that a right good mixing

256
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,873
- er - you wanna bowl
- and you wanna sieve

257
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,040
- a coarse sieve and what we're gonna
do is just do little bit at a time

258
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,218
and just sieve it out.

259
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,582
And what you'll do is you'll get
all the little bits of root

260
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,489
than haven't quite been chopped up enough
and you have this outrageous sugar here.

261
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:29,955
Right so look at that.

262
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,791
Put the bus back in and
we'll whiz 'em up one more time

263
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,331
- get every little last bit
of flavour out of there.

264
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,395
They cost a quid each
- what's the point in wasting it?

265
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,536
- None at all.

266
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:44,868
So let's give it some.

267
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,810
I'm only going to put half
of this in now. Lovely.

268
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,448
Right - so

269
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:01,854
- again just sieve it and you can
tell like cos this looks really dark

270
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,655
and almost ashy in colour
and I love all that.

271
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,463
And these are good things
for presents you know

272
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,032
- like Christmas
- I gave one of these to my mum.

273
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,328
I just bought about ten quids
worth of vanilla pods

274
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,300
and made a massive great
jar of vanilla sugar.

275
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,939
She's still got it a year and a half later

276
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,837
and it's in an air tight container
and it still tastes pucker.

277
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,136
So - get a little present.

278
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,871
Does that sound boring - as a present?

279
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,709
She was quite pleased.

280
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,344
Least she said she was anyway.

281
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:29,444
And there you go.

282
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,781
You can keep on running it forever.

283
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,150
I'm gonna stop there.

284
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:38,187
So what I'm gonna do now is
we've got these lovely fruit here.

285
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,127
And we're just gonna
sprinkle it with sugar

286
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,823
- now if - it's probably

287
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,960
- I'm probably gonna use about four
or five kind of good spoons of sugar

288
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,696
so I cover absolutely everything.

289
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,341
There's so much fruit there
- you gonna get through all that?

290
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,739
Yeah there's loads of fruit there
but I'm not scared about that at all

291
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,243
- cos any left overs
I just scoop up all the juice

292
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,540
- all the fruit into a bowl

293
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,183
and you can like put it in little pots
with yogurt for breakfast

294
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:03,412
or put it on toast and bake it for
breakfast or you can put 'em in pots

295
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,821
and put like just a normal old
- crumble mix on top.

296
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:08,982
You know and just bake again.

297
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:09,627
I mean

298
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,925
- there's no way you can waste anything
from there and what am I looking for?

299
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,033
Oh yeah brandy.

300
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,929
I'm gonna put brandy on here
so imagine your tart fruit

301
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,040
- your sweet sugar
- and what this brandy and the sugar

302
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:28,510
will do is kind of bake together
to go really syrupy and dead tasty.

303
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,238
If you didn't have brandy
- could you use something else?

304
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,247
Cor yeah I'd say.

305
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,251
I mean any kind of nice sweet wines
- whatever gets you going really.

306
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:39,687
But all you have to do now is bake it
for about 15 minutes

307
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,326
- just enough to soften the fruit
- you don't want it

308
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,792
- you wanna soften it enough
so it's a pleasure to eat.

309
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:48,626
But you don't wanna cook it so much that
it's like a load of old pulp you know

310
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,859
- otherwise you could just boil it up.

311
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:50,660
And that's it really.

312
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,235
To go with that though

313
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,863
- I think one of the most
perfect things is er

314
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,405
- mascapone cream.

315
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:01,012
And you can get - this is like
an Italian soft cheese and it's really,

316
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,910
really rich and it's what they
use in like Tiramasu and stuff.

317
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,142
And you can get it everywhere now.

318
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,286
Supermarkets, Delis the whole caboodle.

319
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:12,550
It's so easy
- I mean all I have to do is plonk it out

320
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,621
- basically sweeten it to taste
so at a guess one and a half spoons

321
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,760
- this will be enough for like ten people
- you only need a little bit.

322
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,333
That's the vanilla sugar again?

323
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,437
Vanilla sugar again yeah
- blooming useful.

324
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,903
And you've got all those lovely
black dots in it from the vanilla.

325
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,203
Presumably you could
just use normal cream?

326
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,970
You could use double cream but mascapone

327
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:39,015
- give it a whirl or even half and half
- it's got an amazing richness.

328
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,843
Er - which I can't really explain.

329
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,179
Real silky and it's quite heavy

330
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,289
- I mean it's quite fattening
but you know who cares?

331
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:50,358
And I just plonk that in the table
- let 'em help themselves.

332
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,928
Lovely.

333
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,870
Eh Jamie how are you mate?

334
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:01,505
You alright mate?

335
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:02,264
Yeah good to see you.

336
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:02,998
Thanks for coming.

337
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,107
No worries - not too late am I?

338
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,540
No - we're cracking away mate
- most of its done.

339
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:11,776
< NOODLE SOUP >

340
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,648
Right so for starter I'm gonna do er

341
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,552
- a fusion broth which basically
is like a noodle soup

342
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,953
- you can do must about
anything with it you know

343
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,720
- vegetarian - chicken
- meat - duck - whatever.

344
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,530
Ee - but I'm gonna do kind of
a posh one today with seafood cos

345
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,359
we wanna impress - don't we...

346
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,399
We do - we've got a chef
coming round for dinner.

347
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,194
Got the big boss coming

348
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,031
- so I've got some nice
scallops in their shell

349
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,435
- if you can't get 'em in the shell
which you can't sometimes

350
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,472
- you can get 'em from the
supermarket and stuff - er

351
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:41,409
- sort of in little containers
already peeled and ready to go.

352
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,478
I've got some clams as well
which are quite nice

353
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,947
- when they open up
- they've got loads of lovely juice

354
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,212
and I've got some nice king prawns
that bend sort of butterfly...

355
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,878
What do you mean by butterfly?

356
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,650
Well basically we just
cut down the vein here

357
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,385
- remove the - the gravel sack

358
00:19:56,562 --> 00:20:00,589
- and then we just open them up along the
- the spinal cord.

359
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,700
It's quite important to remove
the vein isn't it really?

360
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,735
Yeah you don't want to...
grit or anything like that.

361
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,997
No - cos it's what they've eaten so...

362
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,332
Do you two cook together quite a lot then?

363
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,874
Yeah mate two years.

364
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,534
We've been working together
for about two years

365
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,306
- when I first met Jamie he was er
- it's amazing actually

366
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:20,178
- he was quiet head down
and within about a month

367
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,115
you know he was just like loud,

368
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:26,121
sort of gregarious young lad...
hovering around the kitchen.

369
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,159
Quite infectious really.

370
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,193
What was Ben like then Jamie?

371
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,421
When I first met
- when I first met Ben actually

372
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,691
- I thought Christ he looks
like Don Johnson you know

373
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:38,199
- a bit swarvy - bit of a sun tun
- open - open shirt - bit of

374
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,931
- couple of hairs you know there
- and white pair of socks.

375
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,635
I don't know whether to pay you
or sort of stab you...

376
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,371
Ben do you mind if we do some herbs mate?

377
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:56,011
Get a nice big sheet of er - tin foil

378
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,613
- toss us a bit of oil mate
- salt and pepper.

379
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,387
Yeah lovely.

380
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,559
Imagine this is like a letter or
a Christmas present or something like that

381
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,824
- and er
- just put a bit of oil on the bottom

382
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,834
- some salt and pepper and clams
are probably going to need

383
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,029
the most amount of heat yeah

384
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,232
- just put 'em in the middle and
then the second thing what we need...

385
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,970
is the scallops
- so just lay these on top -

386
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,115
And then we put the prawns

387
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,117
- cos they'll be last and
they're quite happy to cook last really.

388
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,153
Bit of salt on top and then what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna fold this over

389
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,489
- so already we've got one sealed side

390
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:42,032
and then on this side we just fold it
over nice and sort of clean

391
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,667
- and fold it over again.

392
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,934
Fold it over again and fold it over again

393
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,629
- just until you start to feel the kind of

394
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,174
- the clams or the seafood
- and turn it over

395
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,834
- that's the second side sealed.

396
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,472
And the second - on the third one here

397
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,516
- do exactly the same and I can feel
'em there - so we're sorted there.

398
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,277
And on this last one
- before we seal it er

399
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,286
- we wanna get some moisture in there.

400
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,792
If you fancy you can use

401
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,758
- you can use water
- or vermouth or whatever.

402
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,331
I'm gonna put a bit of white wine
- just a little lug - nothing too much.

403
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:19,032
Just make it steam basically
- get all the juices flowing.

404
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,063
Presumably you could cook other fish
and things as well?

405
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,936
Oh God yeah
- this is such a good way to cook

406
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,974
- I mean you can do

407
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,236
- well you can do all sorts
of fish can't you

408
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,403
- whole fish - filleted fish.

409
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,242
I know I used to do er - chicken
- I used to do chicken at home

410
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,113
- and put noodles in there
- chicken in there

411
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,379
- loads of herbs and white wine,

412
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:40,423
some olive oil and just seal it up
and then like if my flatmate came home

413
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,215
- open up the fridge

414
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,826
- chuck it in the oven
- half an hour it's all done.

415
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,427
I mean it's a wicked way to cook.

416
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,789
So - anyway...

417
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,432
Nice flatmate to have?

418
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,566
Now what I'm gonna do is just
put that on something sturdy.

419
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:59,907
The important thing is you don't wanna
- don't wanna crack or pierce the er

420
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,672
- tin foil so the juice goes everywhere
- and I just

421
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:06,246
- put that in the oven for
about 8 minutes you know

422
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,613
- 6-8 minutes
- just enough to open the clams up

423
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,584
- and by the time the clams are open
everything else will be perfect.

424
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,719
You're cracking on the herbs.

425
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,881
What have you got there?

426
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:22,626
We've got basil - we've got chervil
- bit or oregano - er coriander, dill -

427
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,632
Not that important that
you got loads of herbs

428
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,363
- if you just like coriander and basil
- then get those two.

429
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,765
The whole thing about this dish
is it can be as easy

430
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,008
or as complicated as you like.

431
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,508
It's really it's an assembly of things

432
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,647
- so starting with your stock which is the
base of most soups but especially this one

433
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,009
- it's more like a broth - yeah

434
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,707
- so we've got that and
that's lovely and tasty.

435
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:40,817
I've got my herbs.

436
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,476
I've got the seafood in the oven.

437
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,121
I'm gonna start cooking the noodles.

438
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,519
I just got a
- you can use whatever noodles you like

439
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,223
- er- got these from Chinatown
- they're rice noodles.

440
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,658
Fr - And I've had 'em before
and they're quite nice.

441
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,957
Big handful of salt yeah
- in the boiling water.

442
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,293
Like pasta
- you've always got to have salt.

443
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,331
Right just move those noodles
about so they don't stick.

444
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:03,235
Now what I'm gonna do
is my stock's boiling away

445
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,406
- I'm just gonna peel my ginger.

446
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,068
The idea really was with the chillie

447
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,806
and the ginger is to slice
it as thinly as possible.

448
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,416
I'm gonna put this into my broth
which is ticking over nicely

449
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,885
- these chillies are reasonably
hot but we're taking the seeds out

450
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,081
which is kind of the hottest bit isn't?

451
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,792
So it's not gonna blow people's heads off

452
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,828
but you'll get that lovely kind of
fragrant warmth which is quite pucker.

453
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,726
Just cut 'em nice and thin.

454
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,060
I think these noodles will done now.

455
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:31,869
These just need to be cooked.

456
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,902
They're not like spaghetti
or anything which is al dente

457
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,973
- they're quite soft but
- they're don't - they're perfect.

458
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,807
Shall I put those in a bowl now or?

459
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,749
Yeah - you got to test this once.

460
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,253
Yeah lovely jubbly.

461
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,729
I'll have some of that.

462
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:08,798
So I'll give it a couple of nice clams

463
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,374
- and a nice big scallop yeah.

464
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:19,577
Right - some mixed er - chillies

465
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,520
- I've got some er
- black beans here which I've cooked

466
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,918
- they were dried
so I've soaked them overnight

467
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,615
- and just cooked 'em till tender.

468
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,056
Er - but you can use
any kind of thing really.

469
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:32,660
The beans are quite nice cos
they're like little...

470
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,526
you know what I mean
they fall down the bottom

471
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,462
but you know you tuck
into 'em a bit later.

472
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,468
They're a really great colour and...
contrast.

473
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,503
And then you've got this boiling hot stock

474
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,040
- serve it in this little
teapot cos it looks funky.

475
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,043
Right - and... chuck loads of herbs

476
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,681
- Ben chuck a load of herbs in there
and it's like a tea bag now

477
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,784
- it's like a cup of tea
- I mean all those fragrances lovely.

478
00:25:56,254 --> 00:26:00,816
Come along - give it some of this
- really is like a cup of tea isn't it?

479
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,420
Um - looks fantastic.

480
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,093
Going to have a prawn first I think.

481
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,821
You little tiger.

482
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,266
Fantastic.

483
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:10,799
Do you like it?

484
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,267
- Do you reckon they're gonna approve or
do you reckon we're gonna get the old lip?

485
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,797
No I approve mate - two thumbs up.

486
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,699
What's chef gonna say about that?

487
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,648
More seasoning.

488
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,542
It's not French enough is it?

489
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:29,543
No - right - let's...
we've had our little pre dinner taster so

490
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,350
- get ready to do the full Monty mate.
